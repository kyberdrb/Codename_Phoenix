== Human needs / Menschliche Bedürfnisse / Ľudské potreby

by / nach / podľa Manfred Max-Neef, Marshall B. Rosenberg and me

---

The needs is *the only reason*, why I'm feeling the way I'm feeling. Not the actions of other people, or the state of the environment. These are only the stimulus for my feelings.

*What is a need? / Was ist ein Bedürfnis?*

* Life seeking expression within oneself.
* Manifestation of the divine energy in each living phenomenon, in each life form. link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcq9BEXt4I&feature=youtu.be&t=767[Dr Julia Kim - The Gross National Happiness of Bhutan: 12:47-13:01]
* A *need* is a manifestation of life, a manifestation of divine energy within us. All human beings have the same needs. A *value* is a need with a particular level of importance. The importance of a need changes with time, circumstances and preferences.
* A present manifestation of divine energy within us. It's a life force. It's beauty. The life energy within me. link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfJ_NasCFfQ&feature=youtu.be&t=1422[Marshall Rosenberg Experiencing Needs as Gifts CD NVC Nonviolent Communication: 23:42-26:29]
* The need is "Why you want something?" ... Then you will discover a pool of why's that all humans share. link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mErG7mSzwkc&feature=youtu.be&t=4085[Miki Kashtan - Liberation 1: 1:08:05]
* A need is something that all infants have. When an infant doesn't need it, it's not a need. link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mErG7mSzwkc&feature=youtu.be&t=4085[Miki Kashtan - Liberation 1: 1:08:05]

== Feelings at unfulfilled needs (Sweet pain - Girrafe mourning) / Gefühle bei unerfüllten Bedürfnissen

These feelings come from needs, from the connection to our needs or the needs of others.

The connection to our needs is supported by our thinking.

The thinking that is connected to needs and peace promoting produces these kind of feelings. These feelings are natural to us.

*So it's not only about our connection to _needs_. It's also about the _thinking_ that strenghtens our connection to our needs.*

I found out that *gratitude* and *thanksgiving* for things that [repeatedly] annoy me helps me promote calmness and understanding for these things or other people's remarks or for what other people do. Maybe *gratitude* will help me to cope with things that I take personally. So even when my needs aren't getting met, *I can still think in a way that helps me understand the good reasons, why may be the person do something*, by thanking them for what they had done. So that *I can be more robust and exercise my gratitude, peace promoting thinking and Nonviolent Communincation skills and principles* for what they had done. +
*I can use all the traumatic experiences to exercising my power to empathize and to support peace in my thinking by gratitude.*

== Feelings at fulfilled needs - Dream Feelings - Flow

Gefühle bei erfüllten Bedürfnissen / Pocity pri naplnených potrebách.

How do I want to feel? [RPM]

---

[line-through]#(November 2019) Ich kann meine Gefühle beschreiben, die ich bei meinen Traumaktivitäten erleben möchte, weil ich nicht den Wortschatz an Gefühle habe. Ich brauche mir die Äußerung meiner Gefühle erreichern. Ich brauche die Fähigkeit, die Gefühle in mir bewusst werden und sie benennen. Dann kann ich mir an maine Traumgefühle erinnern und sie gleich wiederherstellen.#

* Does religion, childhood trauma, disfunctional families, oppression and obedience training in families, schools, work promote guilt, shame, ruminescing and regrets  about the past (spytovanie svedomia), worries and fear of the future (the great savior will come, but nobody knows when; will I go to heaven or to hell?; how can I buy the way to heaven most effectively? by following the rules of authority? really?); obedience instead of respect and responsibility, default mode network (DMN) hyperconnectivity, depression, compulsions, obsessions, anger? Well, they might say one thing and do another that totally contraditcts the words. Just because it's Holy Word doesn't mean it's nonviolent. Acts that negate and oppose the words. Let's remind us religious violence. Violence in the name of God. Destroying gifts of life that God is giving to us. Just like in the academy...

* Questions of justice

. What was the observable behavior of the perpetrator?
. Empathy of the perpetrator for the victim. - What needs was the perpetrator trying to meet? - Empathy with the perpetrator's inner chooser. Empathy with the victim's unfulfilled needs. The cost or impact of the perpetrator's behavior to the needs of other people.
. Giraffe mourning on the part of the perpertator. - What needs the perpetrator didn't meet by his/her behavior? - Self-forgiveness within the perpetrator
. Searching for ways to get everybody's needs met that would be more efficient and less costly. - Repairing the harm and healing the pain with concrete activities of the perpetrator that will contribute to life well-being of others.

== Play

by Peter Gray, author of _Self-Directed Education [SDE]_

Ich kämpfe nicht. Ich übersetze alles in die Sprache des Lebens.

Ich arbeite nicht. Ichspiele. Ich lerne. Ich mache.

Hypothese: Jede Aktivität hat in sich Elemente eines Spiels.

Hypothese: Jede Aktivität ist ein Spiel, solange sie unsere Bedürfnisse erfüllt.

Hypothese: Alles, was ich mache, mache ich, um meine Bedürfnisse zu erfüllen.

*** *It will be play if you're connected to your needs.* link:...[M.B. Rosenberg San Francisco Workshop ? : ???-???]
*** Everything I do is play.
*** I do everything that serves life as if it was play.

  ** [32:28] But there's no point at which they say ... "Now I'm no longer playing, now I'm working." Then they go into their adult lifes with the same playful attitude that they took as children when engaged in playing in these activities.

. *It's freely chosen and self-directed.*

    * Adults do not direct children's activities. [Adults trust children. They presume that they know what they're doing] [40:59]
    * Freedom to change the rules.
    * Freedom to choose the activity.
    * Freedom to quit the activity at any time.
    * Balance between skills and challenge: what you can do and what can be done [Flow]. link:???[Happiness and Its Causes - Mihály Csíkszentmihályi 2014 Living in Flow: ???-???]

    * You are not doing it for some reward that's outside of the play itself.
    * Means over the end.
    * Process over product.
    * Skill over result.
    * Intrinsic over extrinsic.
    * The joy of play is in the doing, not in the end product.
    * You do the activity do make the next step in the activity. link:???[Happiness and Its Causes - Mihály Csíkszentmihályi 2014 Living in Flow: ???-???]
    * You do the activity not because of the end result. +
    You do the activity because you want to do the activity. Because you like how you feel when you do the activity. And you like it so much you want to do it every day. link:https://youtu.be/nraBwnT2XlY?t=255[bromont 1 - Doug Newburg - RPM - Resonance Performance Model: 4:15-5:02]
    * How you feel is more important than what you do. link:???[Cedric Dumont - From Fear to Flow: ???-???]
    * The act of learning is more important than how well you are learning. link:???[Alfie Kohn: ???-???]

. *Play is always guided by rules.*

    * The rules create the structure. The structure is the rules.
    * There is no such thing as unstructured play. Play always has a structure. Play is not a random activity. link:???[Rachel Rainbolt - Episode ??? - Peter Gray: ???-???]
    * The structure is always determined by the players. The players themselves choose which rules they want to follow. link:???[Rachel Rainbolt - Episode ??? - Peter Gray: ???-???]
    * Consensual rules [M.B. Rosenberg]

. *Play involves elements of imagination.*

    * Play encourages hypothetical thining: "If this was true, what follows from that?" link:???[Rachel Rainbolt - Episode ??? - Peter Gray: ???-???]
    * *Hypothetical thinking is the highest form of human thinking. _[IQ]_* link:???[Rachel Rainbolt - Episode ??? - Peter Gray: ???-???]
    * *Observing without evaluating is the highest form of human intelligence. _[EQ]_* link:???[Jiddu Krishnamurti]
    * That's why we can plan for the future, prepare for tomorrow, invent things. link:???[Rachel Rainbolt - Episode ??? - Peter Gray: ???-???]
    * None of these abilities can be taught by lecturing, although they are essential life skills. These abilities can only be obtaines through practical experience, through practice. For children is this practical experience, mainly, play. They are preparing themselves for a responsible life. link:???[Rachel Rainbolt - Episode ??? - Peter Gray: ???-???]
    * Both, hypothetical thinking and observing without evaluating helps me to concentrate on what's alive in me and other people - our feelings and needs. Even if it involved screaming my feelings and needs!

. *Play involves relaxed, highly attentive, but not highly stressed attitude.*

    * Why not highly stressed?
    ** Because there are no consequences to it.
    ** You are free to fail.
    ** You are not going to blame anybody. [There is no need for it.]
    ** There is no trophy; there is no cake. link:???[The cake is a lie. (Portal)]
    ** You are not going to get an F from some teacher.
    ** You are free to quit.
    ** You are not concerned about even succeeding. link:???[Happiness and Its Causes - Mihály Csíkszentmihályi 2014 Living in Flow: ???-???]
    ** You're trying to do your best, but there's no problem with not doing your best because there are no real world consequences. [link:https://www.montessorieducation.com/podcast-jesse-mccarthy/[MONTESSORI EDUCATION WITH JESSE MCCARTHY - Play | Peter Gray: 29:22-29:35]]

. *Play always involves challenges.*

    * One of the challenge is: "How much fear can I tolerate?".
    * You are playing with your own fear.
    * We develop a sense of our own abilities.
    * We learn how to manage fear.
    * *I can feel fear, and I can survive it.*
        ** This discovery can be very empowering. It makes you less affraid of life. It helps you live your life courageously. Things can happen that are scary and I can deal with them.
        ** If you are deprived of this kind of risky play that involves deliberately putting yourself into a scary situation, then the first time you feel a real emergency in your life, you might fall apart because you didn't have the opportunity to practice how to deal with fear, how to control your body, how to control your mind, [how to control your own emotions and show yourself empathy,] when you feel fear.
    * If something serious happens, [or you get stuck,] ask for help.
    * *To protect children from any possible harm by not allowing them adventures or risky play, and never allowing them to get out of our sight and control, is having harmful long-term consequences on children.*
    * Someone who is willing to take more eisks in the daily life will not only become better and improve, expand the comfort zone, but also more fulfilled, happy and satisfied. link:???[Cedric Dumont - From Fear to Flow: ???-???]
    * You'll learn how to accept and learn from failure. It leads to sustainable resuslts, more engagement, satisfaction, [instrinsic] motivation. link:???[Cedric Dumont - From Fear to Flow: ???-???]
    * When you stop taing risks, you stop living a life. link:???[Cedric Dumont - From Fear to Flow: ???-???]

* Part of their egalitarian view is an *extraordinarily respect for individual autonomy*. *They don't believe it is proper to tell somebody else what to do.* Even if you do better than somebody else, you see them doing it 'wrong', you don't go and tell them a better way to do it ... you might find some way of demonstrating it ..., by joking, or something to help convey them, help them out, but you don't just go and say "This is how you should do it!" because that would make it seem like you believe you're better than the in some sense. You don't really have the right to tell somebody else how they should do things or what they should do. ... this applies to children as well. They don't believe it's right to tell children what to do. And apparently they don't tell children what to do. +
This survey of antropologists lead me to three conclusions that I think are really significant regarding the self-directed education: +
  . *Adults do not direct childrens activities.* +
    *** *"Hunter-gatherers do not give orders to their children, for example no adult anounces bedtime. At night children remain around adults until they feel tired and fall asleep. Adults do not interfere with their children's lives. They never beat, scold or behave aggresively with them physically or verbally, nor do they offer praise or keep track of their development."* _[I cried at this on Tuesday 3.11.2020]_ ... Praise, if you think about it, we kind of think that praise is good, but criticism is bad, or punishment is bad, but a praise is really just the flipside, so witholding praise... *If you're somebody who praises, the frst time you withhold it, that's punishment*... So they just make the assumption that their kids are gonna be okay, they don't feel like they've gotta direct the kid's behavior by praising what they want them to do, or criticising or punishing them for what they don't want them to do. They just assume that their kids are gonna be okay. +
     +
    *"The idea that this is my child or your child does not exist. Deciding what another person should do no matter what his age is outside of ... vocabulary or behavior. There is great interest in what everybody does, but no impulse to influence, let alone coerce anyone.* +
    *The child's will is his motor force"* +
    I talked about *will* as one of the basic drives. The hunter-gatherers were people who respected will. They thought that the development, the elaboration of your own will is really, really important so *they would not suppress [they would promote] the child's wilfullness*. +
     +
    *Infants and young children are allowed to explore their environments to limits of their physical capacities, and with minimal interference from adults. Thus when a child picks up a hazardous object parents generally leave it to explore the dangers on its own. The child is presumed what it is doing.* +
    Why don't the parents stop them?
    **** *Well, that's what he wants to do, you know? Why should I stop them?*

    . *The clear understanding that education is children’s responsibility*
      *** *Education is the child's responsibility. When children know that they're responsible for their education, they take that responsibility.*
      *** *When they're led to believe that somebody else is responsible for their education*, and all they have to do is do what they're told, then *they tend to do that in an minimal way*, and they don't tend to take responsibility for their education.
    . *Unlimited time to play, explore, and pursue one’s own interests*
      *** I need time to understand things.
    . *Opportunity to play with the tools of the culture*
      *** driving a car, operating a computer
    . *Access to a variety of caring adults, who are helpers, not judges*
      *** "The last person you wanna go to, to help you learn something, is somebody who's evaluating you. You're nervous about that person. That person is a person you go to in more of frame of mind of trying to impress that person with how much you know, not to say 'I really don't know this, and I would like some help with this." So by not judging the children the staff members are much better to be helpers to the children, than teachers in a typical school could be.
    . *Free age mixing among children and adolescents*
      *** ... that's absolutely key to the school. *The school would not work if there were children of all the same age* because children don't have much to learn from others who are the same age. They learn from children who are older, and from children who are younger than themselves.

      *** We are in an age when we're involved in a horrid social experiment: "What happens if we take play away from children?" "What happens if we take freedom away from them?" So that they're pretty much always either at school, or they're under adult direction outside of school. And they have almost no time to just be children away from adults, figuring out the world themselves, learning how to get along with other people. Much of my research in writing has to do with the fact that children, and young adults too, are suffering these days because of *play deprivation*. [reference to self-directed executive functioning] +
      [link:https://www.montessorieducation.com/podcast/play-peter-gray[MONTESSORI EDUCATION WITH JESSE MCCARTHY - Play | Peter Gray: 6:13-7:08]]
      *** ... I've written a lot about the fact that over the same decades that we have gradually been taking children's freedom away from them and gradually been having them spending more and more time in school, more and more time under adult direction, less and less time playing, exploring, following their own interests, over this period of time that we've seen huge decreases in children's freedom, we've seen huge increases in all sorts of mental disorders in childhood and young adulthood. Huge increases, no comparison. The rates of anxiety, depression, childhood suicide, are way, way greater, than they were in the past. ... *There is in my mind no question that there is a causal link. When you take children's freeedom away from them and when you put them more or less always in situations where they're being judged and evaluated by adults, these are anxiety provoking situations, you are going to produce children who are depressed, anxious and sometimes even suicidal. And that is the tragedy of our times. *Play is not a luxury for children. Play is a necessity.* If we want our children to grow up psychologically and socially healthy, we have to stop being so concerned about testing and academics. *There is no evidence that all of this homework, all of this focus on academia, that even in terms of academic learning there is no evidence they're learning more, than they would be if they were spending half as much time on that.* We need to go in the other direction. We need to reduce the amount of time that children will spend under adult direction, and increase the amount of time that they have to learn how to take care of themselves which they do through play. +
      ... [We're] coming full circle to that internal locus of control. One of the things with anxiety and depression, and definitelly suicide, is that *"I can't controll my life."* And that is one of the core elements of it. ... He didn't learn to control his life. The teacher and his parents have been controlling his life [all the time]. So how would we expect him to [take responsibility] later?

      **** I ask my brain to just take on a tiny little piece of [the task], and see how it feels. Because even when I take on a tiny little piece of it, then I've already gotten started, and the starting is the hard part.
      **** For example, ... "Do you want to come for a walk with us ... ?" ... I just say "Ok. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go get my shoes." ... and then I'll decide whether I'm gonna come out for a walk or not.
      **** ... by the time I've gotten started on the tash, following through on the task is so much less difficult.
      **** Tell yourself you're just gonna do the very, very beginning stages of the task, and then ... spend less than a minute on the beginning stages, and if you still don't feel like doing that task, then you just give yourself [a break for, let's say] an hour [or empathy], [without] shame, [without] judgement.

    *** *Internal Locus of Control*
      **** ... the main thing that children develop through [self-directed executive functioning and] freedom away from adults is what's called an internal locus of control.
      **** *I can take charge of my own life.*
      **** *I can solve my own problems.*
      **** *I can figure things out myself.*
      **** *I don't need a powerful other person to do things for me.*
      **** *I'm not a victim of faith or circumstance.*
      **** *I can be in charge of my own life.*
      **** *I can take responsibility for my own life.*
      **** There's actually a psychological test for clinical questionare that assesses the degree to which people have this internal locus of control. And no surprise, ever since the test was developed, around 1960, the scores on internal locus of control for school age children has been continuously going down. I'm convinced that this is because they're not allowed to take control of their own lives. They're always being controlled. They're always being told what to do. *This sense of ... responsibility for [our] own life. is way more important than the academic things that we learn in school. The academic things you learn in school are easy to learn once you have learned to take control of your own life.*
    *** *External Locus of Control*
      **** control by circumstances outside of the person
      **** The system, structures, institutions, outside environment control my behavior and shape my reality. link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVXqB2CnR6s["Nonviolent Communication": Paula Gloria´s Interview with Marshall Rosenberg]
      **** There is good reason to believe that the rise of external locus of control is causally linked to the rise in anxiety and depression. Clinical researchers have shown repeatedly—with children, adolescents, and adults—that the helpless feelings associated with an external locus of control predispose people for anxiety and depression [20]. *When people believe that they have little or no control over their fate, they become anxious. They think, “Something terrible can happen to me at any time, and I will be unable to do anything about it.” When the anxiety and sense of helplessness become too great, people become depressed.* They feel, “There is no use trying; I’m doomed.” Research has also shown that those with an external locus of control are less likely to take responsibility for their own health, their own futures, and their community than are those with an internal locus [21].
      **** She refers also to evidence that the pursuit of extrinsic goals at the expense of intrinsic goals correlates with anxiety and depression [30].
      **** ... *play deprivation* would lead to an external locus
of control.
      **** Individuals suffering from anxiety disorders describe losing emotional control as one of their greatest fears [41].
      **** ... inability to control anger in conflicts with other people, in childhood as well as in adulthood, is part and parcel of narcissists’ inability to make positive, intimate, social connections [43].
      **** *Perhaps the most straightforward explanation for the rise of depression and anxiety in children and adolescents is that, as a society, we have increasingly forced them into settings that make them unhappy and anxious and have deprived them of the activities that make them happy.*
      **** *Somehow, as a society, we have come to the conclusion that to protect children from danger and to educate them, we must deprive them of the very activity that makes them happiest and place them for ever more hours in settings where they are more or less continually directed and evaluated by adults, settings almost designed to produce anxiety and depression. If we wish children to be happy and to grow up to become socially and emotionally fulfilled and competent adults, we must provide them, once again, with opportunities to spend many hours per day playing freely with friends.*

* communication (communication skills, dialogue) and
* using power (means of influence, leadership, management, parenting, pedagogy)

that is connected to life and stimulates peace.

* What is the message of all religions?
** To live compassionately. To not do anything that isn't play. Unfortunately, religions are vague in the specific ways, how to live compassionately and enjoy compassionately.
* What skill do we need to live compassionately?
** Language, thinking, communication and use of power.
* Why don't we educate peopleto live compassionately, but instead we educate them to enjoy violence?
** We have been educated to enjoy violence, in order to contribute to the structures [institutions] of the society. In these structures are people that claim to be superior and know what's right for others, and have the power to impose what they believe is right on others. That way of living requires a certain way of thinking, communication, talking and using power. That is the problem. [The sustaining of the structures is more than contributing to the well-being of the society.]
* How are we meant to live?
** To live naturaly, compassionately.
* How to live natrally?
** Natural living is the usage of our power to enrich my and other people's needs.

* The entire concept of a mental illness and the attribution of the violence as a cause of the mentall illness takes the focus away from the education [and upbringing] that the structures provide which create the [environment for] violence.

They do what they're told by the people above. They do what their parents want. They do what their teachers want. What the bosses want. What the government wants. They are nice, dead people.
. Or they become monsters.

The education to violence is just a temporary thing. Although it takes for approximately 5000 years. By the paleontologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, we are gradually returning back to the ways of living that are more natural.

Everything that we do out of penitence or self-hate, fear of punishment, desire for reward, concept of deserve, duty, obligation, submission, rebellion, giving in or self-sacrifice, buying love, guilt, shame, anger, depression, everybody pays for it. Therefore *don't do things for other people. Do things only when you do so willingly to enrich your and other people's life.* If you do things from the energy that damages life, it will affect commitment to values that serve life, care about other people, depth of thinking, interest in learning, preference to challenge link:???[M.B.

== Managing the commons

*The commons* are those things that we all own together, that are neither privately owned, nor managed by the government on our behalf.

. *Commons have clearly defined boundaries* +
In particular, who is entitled to access to what? Unless there’s a specified community of benefit, it becomes a free for all, and that’s not how commons work. [Everyone contributes to the common good of the commons - the shared resource - and the community. Everybody 'pays' for using the common resource by taking care of it. Just like bees or ants. Reference to Mutual Aid - Peter Kropotkin - Chapter 1]

. *Rules fit local circumstances* +
There is no one-size-fits-all approach to common resource management. Rules are set consensualy by *local* people by their *needs*.

. *Decisions are adopted by consensus* +
There are all kinds of ways to make it happen, but people will be more likely to follow the rules if they had a hand in writing them. Involve as many people as possible in decision-making. [Maybe Nonviolent Communication (NVC) can help to simplify and accelerate this process.]

. *Commons are monitored* +
Once rules have been set, communities need a way of checking that people are keeping them [taking care of them]. Commons don’t run [not only on] good will, but [also] on accountability.

. *Sanctions for those who abuse the commons are graduated* +
Ostrom observed that the commons that worked best didn’t just ban people who broke the rules. That tended to create resentment. Instead, they had systems of warnings and fines, as well as informal reputational consequences in the community [that gradually increased the intensity of consequences. The consequences are not taken by the community as punishment, but as a way to educate the perpetrator through resotrative justice and mediation to learn how to use the resource.]

. *Conflict resolution is easily accessible* +
When issues come up, resolving them is informal, cheap and straightforward. That means that anyone can take their problems for mediation, and the needs of everybody are taken into consideration. Problems are solved rather than ignoring them because nobody wants to pay legal fees [fees for lawyers and then wait forever for final decision of the court].

. *Commons need to organise* +
Your commons rules needs to be acknowledged by the local authorities as legitimate.

. *Commons work best when nested within larger networks* +
Some things can be managed locally, but some might need wider regional cooperation – for example an irrigation network might depend on a river that others also draw on upstream.

The ‘tragedy of the commons’ is real, but it is not inevitable. It is possible to create and operate thriving commons, a third way besides private ownership and government control. +
... *we all depend on global commons such as the atmosphere or the oceans* ... +
*[Our life depends on the conditions we create for ourselves on the earth.]*

Mussolini created the _Fasci Italiani di Combattimento (Liktorské zväzky prútov)_ which consisted mostly of men [patriarchy] and *glorified violence* [glorification of violence]. Violence lies at the heart of fascism. link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE-ewzt9Yfg[What is Fascism? | World History Project: ] +

*What is Fascism?* link:https://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/rschwart/hist151/Paxton_Fascism/Paxton_mainpoints.htm[Robert Paxton] +
Fascism may be defined as +
a form of political behavior +
marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victimhood +
and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, +
in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, +
working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, +
abandons democratic liberties +
and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.

Socialism, marxism, communism did the same. They were also violent, totalitarian, authoritarian, despotic and patriarchal. This is not democracy. Not representative, nor direct. They have nothing to do with freedom and fulfilling needs of EVERYBODY, not just a some "elected" group of people that "lives closer to God". link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTJQXKUR6mM[The Soviet Story], link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_in_Marxism[Democracy in Marxism], link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship_of_the_proletariat[Dictatorship of the proletariat] +

* Fascism, authoritarianism or populism support *power over* people, not *power with* people, like Mary Parker Follett, Mahatma Gandhi, Marshall B. Rosenberg did.

*What do all of these regimes have in common? VIOLENCE!* +
Glorification of violence. As if it was the ultimate means to achieve anything. What about nonviolence? Ethics? Humanity? Trustworthiness? Freedom? Autonomy? Joy of life? Hm? They didn't think about that, did they? +
*Why it always ends up with violence? WHY?*

When we have evidence that restorative (instead  of retributive) approaches solves the violent acts to a much deeper and longer lasting way.

Because of pseudo-scientific assumptions of human nature? In order to justify violence? I just feel sick of all these ideologies.

What about *critical thinking*? Pluralism? Diversity? Tolerance? Thinking for ourselves and questioning authorities? Inviting descent, discussion, mutual compassion and understanding?

== Quotes

plain or paraphrased

*The Montessori Method*

* Chapter 15: Intellectual Education (librivox)

** 0:49-1:33

    *** The directress/educator intervenes to lead the child from sensations to ideas, from the concrete to the abstract and to the association of ideas. For this, she uses a method which isolates the inner attention of the child and to focus it upon the perceptions. As in the first lessons, his objective attention was fixed in isolation upon single stimuli. The teacher, in other words, when she gives a lesson, limits the field of the child's consciousness to the object of the lesson. As, for example, during the sense education, she isolated the sense which she whished the child to exercise.
        **** When the teacher gives a lesson, he limits the field of consciousness of the student to a single stimuli - to the object of the lesson - e.g. by exercising only one of the student's senses at a time.

** 1:39-1:53

    *** The educator limits his/her intervention to the greatest possible extent, and at the same time shows care for the other person's well-being by *requesting* the other person to stop the autoeducation when the educator sees that the other person feels tired.
      **** Intervention: As much as necessary, but as little as possible.
      **** Burnout prevention.
      **** Learning of emotional intelligence and mindfulness.
    
** 2:01-2:10

*** ... in other words, in the quality of the teacher's intervention lies the art which makes up the individuality of the teacher.
  **** maybe NVC will improve that quality)

** 2:10-2:17

*** An important part of the teachers work is that of teaching an *exact nomenclature*.
**** Describing things accurately
**** pronouncing clearly and loudly
**** explaining the meaning and differences understandably

** 4:56-6:23

    *** But, if he has not done this, that is, if he makes a mistake, she does not correct him, but suspends her lesson to take it up another day. Indeed, why correct him? If the child has not succeeded in associating the name with the object, the only way in which he succeeds would be to repeat both the action of the sense stimuli and the name. In other words, to repeat the lesson. But when the child has failed, we know, that he was not at that moment ready for the psychic association which we wished to provoke in him. Therefore, we choose another moment. If we correct the child by saying "No, you have made a mistake!", all these words, which, being in the form of reprove, would strike him more forcibly and would remain in the mind of the child retarding the learning. On the contrary, the silence which follows the error leaves the field of consciousness clear and the next lesson may successfully follow the first. In fact, by revealing the error we may lead the child to make an undue effort to remember, or we may discourage him. And it is our responsibility to avoid, as much as possible, all unnatural effort, and all the pressure [depression].

** 8:08-8:17

    *** The teacher carefully watches when and how the child arrives at the generalization of ideas.

** 9:13-9:21

    *** The goal of education is to promote the *spontaneous* development of a human. / Das Ziel der Ausbildung ist, die spontane Entwicklung des Menschen zu unterstützen.

** 10:50-11:20

    *** We can not create observers by saying "Observe!", but by giving them the power and the abilities for these observations. And these abilities are obtained through the education of the senses. Once we have aroused such an activity, autoeducation is assured. Refined, well-trained senses, lead us to a closer observation of the environment, and this with its infinite variety attracts the attention and continues the psychosensory education.

** 13:16-13:28

    *** The spontaneous development of the child continues indefinitely and is in direct relation to the psychic potentiality of the child himself and not with the work of the teacher.

** 13:28-13:39

    *** The spontaneous activity starts from the education of the senses, and is maintained by observation.

** 13:29-13:49

    *** The human receives his/her ability, not from the education given by the master, but from special acuteness/sensitivity of his/her senses.

** 13:49-14:03

    *** When somebody is in an environment where he/she can apply his senses in his/her's spontaneous activity, the activity itself gives him/her the pleasure, joy and fulfillment

    **** Develpoment of intrinsic motivation (Alfie Kohn)
    **** The activity becomes *autotelic* (Mihály Csíkszentmihályi - Flow)
    **** Process over Product (Rachel Rainbolt, Peter Gray)

* Montessori put her theories into practice in *Casa dei Bambini* in San Lorenzo, 1907. +
Until that time people had thought of children as empty vessels or cups which had to be filled with knowledge. Knowledge was simply poured into them. All he children had to do was to sit still and take it in. Maria Montessori observed that children learned in a very different way. That they spontaneously reached out for knowledge, that they explored they created. Looking at very young children we can see the spontaneity. And in fact, a lot of what was happening in schools was preventing that and stopping children [from being spontaneous]. +
She believed that, if given the opportunity, children would rather focus their attention on work than idleness. +
Montessori discovered so many years ago what modern research is confirming today: that children learn best from their own activity. They learn best when they're active and exploring. And she found a way to make this possible. +
It was a scientific experiment. What she observed in a San Lorenzo project became the basis of Montessori education. She created a new environment. One completely diffrent from mainstream schools in Italy. +
All inovation in Montessori education didn't come about necessarily because Montessori said "We have to do that!". She saw "Well, this is something that I observed children do, and I'm curious how this will affect their experience." And then she applied the science to it. +
As she watched the children engaging with the new materials, she observed that this formally naughty children thrived on learning. They would work for the sake of working and would become completely engaged in their task. +
One child of 4 became so engrosed in her work that when Maria had the other children dance around, and make as much noise and fuss as possible, the girl never deviated from her task. Maria then lifted her from her seat, but the girl just continued working. [Is this a demonstration of *Flow* by Mihály Csíkszentmihályi?] +
Maria also observed that children had an innate love for order. +
The parents often say "Oh, my child doesn't like to tidy up at all." But actually they enjoy doing it, they like the idea of putting something back in order so that it's ready for someone else to use. And at the end of the day you'll often find children on their own deciding around the children's house rolling up matts, making things straight on the shelf. It's a sense of caring for a space, caring for the community. [Is this a demonstration of *The Altruistic Personality* from Samuel and Pearl Oliner?] +
She thought them simple acts of cleanliness, like how to blow their nose. No one had ever told them how to to this before. Montessori understood that children have a sense of personal dignity often not recognized by adults. Neither they require rewards or punishments. The acts they were engaged in were rewarding enough. But the most surprising and remarkable of all her observations was when these children without her orchestrating it taught themselves to read. She had introduced some paper letters mounted on wood as a multisensory tool. The children could trace them with their fingers, feelilng the shape and learning the sound of the letter. She gave them no other instructions. +
The children began put together sounds of words they knew. When they heard a word they didn't know, they could decompose it to letters by sound and write it down. *Montessori managed to ignite an explosion of ideas in children.* +
The *Casa dei Bambini* was an enormous success. Montessori method was starting to get more popularity and attention. Legislators, teachers, parents and doctors [were impressed by the results of this method and] soon started to use this method in their practice. In 1909 she published her book *Il metodo della pedagogia scientifica applicato all'educazione infantile nelle case dei bambini*. In 1912 this book was translated to English and published with the title *The Montessori Method*. The book was translated into multiple languages and spread across the world. link:https://www.kpbs.org/news/2014/jul/16/extraordinary-women-maria-montessori/[Image: Popularity of Montessori method in the world in ~1912]. *Almost the entire world wanted to use Montessori method.* Even the academia. Maria started a revolution in education. link:https://youtu.be/TXqeTYHn0p4?t=1282[(Maria Montessori: 21:22-28:03)] +
By 1913 were in USA almost 100 Montessori schools. +
Then in 1914 war broke out across the Europe. +
To Maria, the appaling devastation convinced her that *there should be a connection between education and pacifism*. "Now comes the time for our work. We are working for peace and humanity midst the inhumanity of war. Our eyes are turned to a little child where lies the future and the hope of our world." +
In France and Belgium Montessori schools were set up for the orphans of the conflict. +
After the first world war, Maria Montessori returned to Italy, only to walk into the path of the world's most ambitious man. *Benito Mussolini* was impressed ... by the discipline of the students educated by Montessori method. He wanted to build a new efficient and industrial country. Mussolini supported Montessori and her's education. ... Mussolini and Montessori cooperated, but neither of them were happy with it. *The trouble was that Montessori believed that children learn best as  [responsible,] independent, free thinkers.* But free thinking was not something that Il Duce was intrested in. *Mussolini's aim was to create a nation of [obedient,] disciplined and loyal fascist.* The idea of Montessori education was educating people to think for themselves, and act for themselves, and was *scientific* rather than political. ... *"The goal [of education of Mussolini and fascism] is total indoctrination. From childhood to the soldiers grade. Fascism shapes young minds with Italy's destiny and the beauty of war."* In 1931 Mussolini announced that all schools must conform to fascism. Maria refused outright. Maria Montessori and her partner left in a hurry. In 1931 she lef her homeland never to live there again. *Within months Mussolini closed all Montessori schools in Italy.* ... Maria Montessori met with Gandhi in London. They had a great connection. Gandhi supported her philosophy: the element of community, an education that can work with all children in all cultures. *Hitler closed down all Montessori schools in Germany. In Berlin, all Montessori books were thrown on burning piles.* [Mussolini and Hitler (and fascist) didn't like citizens that ask "Why?" and complain about regulations] link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXqeTYHn0p4&feature=youtu.be&t=1785[Maria Montessori: 29:45-38:47], link:???[Episode_143-Maria_Montessori-thehistorychicks: 1:24:01-1:40:38] +

In 1945 Maria Montessori started to revive and reestablish her education in preschools and schools in Europe. Many of the creative people benefitted from early Montessori education. *The life should be challenging, and the challenge should be fun.

    *** Little people don't like being controlled even more than big people. ... So when we try to manipulate them with "Good job!", on some level, while they like getting a response that's positive, they don't like being manipulated, and sa anything that we've rewarded them for doing becomes less appealing by that fact alone.

    *** When you listen to these *"BIRG" (link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basking_in_reflected_glory[Basking in Reflected Glory])*, these boastful parents, you start to get the sense that in many cases the accomplishments they're talking about on the part of their children didn't exactly happen on their own [spontaneously - reference to Montessori Method], but were sort of squeezed out of them by a parent who has hovering a little too close, pushing a little too hard, and maybe loving in a way that is problematic. *You can't help wondering, whether those children would still be loved if the kids stopped being so damned impressive.*

    *** *The alternative to praise isn't criticism or chilly silence. The alternative to praise is love that is continuous [and unconditional] where they never feel "I have to do a good job. There are strings attached to my parents excitement about me. Where I have to do well in school, or in sports [or in music], or i have to be 'well behaved' (which our society values apparently more than any of the adjectives you came up with.

    *** *What happens too is that kids who feel that they were conditionaly parented feel as if they're being controlled by remote controll.

Internal is not sufficient. *Internalizing self-discipline is often toxic! Grit often leads kids not to give up when they should let go. ... Grit [is] taking over our schools calling our attention away from whether the kids have been given something to do worth doing!

    That is a disfunctional message based on the research showing that collaboration is actually much more successful even in conventional terms, in most environments, than working alone, *let alone working against everybody else*. +
    But when [people] start to elbow each other away, they become *counterempathic* [Schadenfreude]. +
    Social psychologists find that when they encourage people to compete against other people, they start +

    The problem is not in the neurosis of the individual or the lack of charity. The problem is with the fact that all of our games in the society [and to some extent our economic system] are set up, so that I can succeed only if you fail.

     +
    "Can I get an A?" +
    "Am I gonna get a high test score?" +
    "Is the teacher gonna say 'Good job!'?" +
     +
    Those are completely different sets of goals. One set is about learning, and the other set is about achievement. +

     +
    "How did you decide what will you write about?" assuming you're lucky enough to have a ... teacher who lets you decide. +
    "Did you already know what conclusion you'd come to at the end before you started writing, or did the act of writing kind of changed your mind about this?" +
     +
    Those are interesting, generative questions. But ... there are other parents who's first question is: +
     +
    "What did you get?" +
    "What did the teacher think?" +
    "Is it better that the essay that you wrote couple of months ago?" +
     +
    Those are deeply anti-intelectual questions. *But parents can't ask "What did you get on it?" if the schools know enough to stop giving grades.* +
    *The teachers have to stop blaming the parents when the structure drives the parental as well as the child's behavior in uniquely and uniformly destructive directions.*

    *** ... 'bad things' ... tend to happen when you get [people] too focused on how well they're doing. This is not an argument against excellence [reference to Excellence vs Superiority - Daniel Markovits, Meritocracy]. It's an argument about what happens when you overemphasize achievement in [someone's] head based on the structures in the classroom in schools [or workplaces, or homes]. Here are some of the things that we find tend to happen when kids get too focused on achievement:
    . *[People] tend to become less interested in the learning itself* [55:19]
      **** LLL - The Big Tripple-L - Life Long Learner
      **** The goal of education is to enable individuals to continue their education [John Dewey (1859-1952)]
      **** ... or paraphrased: The goal of education is more education.
      **** ... *the more you get [people] focused on performing well in school, the less likely they are [to focus on what they're learning] to get a kick out of playing with words, or numbers, or ideas.* +
      *They're less likely to get interested in a whole discipline, like writing or science.* +
      *They're likely to find the school itself as something they have to get through, because now the point isn't to make sense of stuff. It's to get better at it. Two completely different frames of mind.*
    . *How [people] explain their success or failure* [56:54]
      **** *When you get [people] focused on achievement, they tend to attribute their success or failure to factors they believe are outside their control, like ability [or luck]* [1:02:30-1:02:46]
      **** ... but if you know anything about educational psychology, you know that *what leads to future success, the best [most accurate] predictor, is not earlier success. It's the reason [somebody] thinks he was successful.*
      **** *This is example ... of how we have to stop focusing on behavior that can be seen and measured.* [An example how insignificant the behavior of somebody else tells us about his motives.]
      **** *Kohn's law* +
      *The more you hear educator or parenting advisors use the word behavior, the less valuable their advice is likely to be.* +
      link:???[??? TILT parenting? source of Kohn's law]+
      [Perhaps] because they are still in a twirl of a totally repudiated field of psychology associated with the late Boris Frederic Skinner B. F. Skinner, man who did most of his research on rodents and pigeons, wrote most of his books about people. *The focus is on the stuff you can see and measure. [Data!] But that's not what tends to drive what happens. It's the needs, the values, the motives that underlie the behaviors that are under the surface.* +
      *What matters for [somebody's] success is not how well he's doing in school, it's WHY he thinks he's doing well in school.* [reference to Locus of control, SDE] +
      ... *not everybody who tries hard and makes an effort does so because they like the subject. This is why the idea of effort as opposed to ability, is another example of our fixation on behavior. What matters isn't just how much effort [people] put in, it's WHY they decided to make the effort.* +
      *If the kid sitting next to him put in at least as much effort because she's desperate for her mum's love, or affraid of being punished, that's not the same kind of effort even though the behavior is the same.* [reference to Epigenetics - genes of identical twins are the same, but one of them becomes an illness and the other doesn't - How outside factors influence human biology.] +
      So be vary of people who just talk about getting [people] to develop a 'growth mindset' where they think everything is within their capability. *'Cause that's just about effort, regardless of what's going on in [somebody's] head, and whether it's worth making an effort at!*
      **** [Bernard Weiner] *For any given task somebody might explain his or her success by saying "I got successful [or I failed] because of:* +
      *effort* [I learned really hard because I liked the subject; I'm able to do what I need to learn this stuff on my own without anybody telling me what to do or how to do it [reference to Internal locus of control] / I didn't study] +
      *task difficulty* [The task was easy / The task was hard] +
      *ability* [I have talent for this / I can't do anything right; I'm not cut out for this [reference to External locus of control]] +
      *luck* [I got lucky / It wasn't my day]
      **** [now jump to the beginning of this point for the conclusion]
    . *[People] tend to pick the easiest possible task if given a choice* [1:02:57]
      **** ... *when you tell that what matters is "Being successful!"*
      **** What she knew that I didn't was *"When you told me you think I can get a better grade in here, you were saying 'Pssst! This is not about intellectual risk taking [reference to Cedric Dumont - From Fear to Flow]. It's about avoiding risks. Of course I'm picking the shortest book. Of course I'm picking a project on a topic I'm already familiar with where I know I can be successful. Because all you care about is success!'"* +
      *Any mother, father, any principal or teacher who talks about kid's success especially on a report card, and that be important, is actively telling kids to avoid things that are challenging.* +
      *And then when the kids do that [when they do pick the easiest possible task] we blame them for not having sufficient grit or motivation. We say: "This kid needs to be more motivated to push himself to try a little harder."* +
      *Yea, maybe the kid will try that, when we get rid of the structural barriers to doing that. Including, but not limited to grades.*
    . *[People] tend to fall apart when they stop succeeding* [1:04:32]
      **** [When you] meet a kid who always gets a 100, and then one day gets a 92 and *the world has ended!* *And our tendency is, once again, to think the problem is rooted in the kids head - attitudes.* +
      *Maladaptive perfectionism.* +
      We say: "Oh, c'mon honey. Don't be so hard on yourself. A 92 is still a very good grade." (We're trying to say exactly the wrong thing: trying to be sympathetic [instead of empathetic - reference to NVC].) ERRR! +
      or: "I'm sure you get a 100 next week." ERRR! +
      What we're saying is a strong, bright line with "OK" on the top, and "not OK" on the bottom. And you made the mistake, you're such a perfectionist, of drawing that line too high. +
      Psychological research says *the problem is the line itself at its salient, not where we draw it.* +
      Most of the people who talk proudly about "raising the bar" in American education. A phrase, by the way, I'm mostly sure it was derived from the world of show horses, which tells you pretty much everything you need to know about the people who talk this way about children. People who have created this *cult of rigor*, *rigorous education*, are *people who are talking about higher standards, are often turning kids off of learning, and discouraging them from challenging themselves from things that are harder to do.* +
       +
      ... *when you get rid of all rewards, [people] tend to spontaneously pick harder things to do. Something just beyond what they're comfortably capable of doing.* +
       +
      *So if they're not doing that because they're lazy. It's because they're rational.* And they fall apart when they suddelny stop performing. And some of those kids do it after really becoming the big fish in a small high school pond, and they get to a smart college where everybody is smart, and they fall apart. They implode. +
      Other kids get this message "I'm not cut out for this." when they're 6 years old, and it's a tragedy.
    . *The more you overemphasize achievement, the more damage you do to kid's social environments* [1:07:13]
      **** ... *because even if it's not explicitly competitive, you have to fail in order for me to succeed, nevertheless the emphasis is not on helping each other, but instead the focus is on doing better than each other.* [reference to Mutual Aid - Peter Kropotkin]
    . *The more you overemphasize achievement, the less successful [people] are at meaningful indicators of intellecutal proficiency* [1:07:36]
      **** ... because I have to admit that if you just give multiple choice tests of memorized how many forgettable facts you crammed into short-term memory, some of the kids with the strong achievement orientation will do well on those tests. But *the more meaningful the measures of learning, the more it turns out almost like a Zen paradox that the [people] who are pushed hardest to succeed often are least successful.* Especially at being able to transfer or generalize something about a lesson, and apply it to a new kind of problem. [reference to Generalization in neural networks; my problems with speed of learning: learning rate - also a reference to neural networks]
      **** thinking in a more superficial way
  ** 1:09:03-1:13:56
    *** What are the causes in schools? +
    Grades [or other kind of dimensional reduction, like points, credits (ECTS), titles, money]
    *** link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdFc2B-tZLc&feature=youtu.be&t=1350[Marshall Rosenberg - Making Life Wonderful 2/4 - Nonviolent Communication NVC: 22:30-25:29]
      **** *What about grades? The only purpose I see in grades is to maintain a cast system in our society and to hide it as a meritocracy or democracy.*
      **** "... also, research shows that *the more grades are given the more students lose perspective on what they're learning.* So *then they learn not for the value of what they're learning, but for the extrinsic rewards*", which of course is the *purpose in the jackal culture*. *You want people to get used to working for extrinsic rewards, things like salaries [points, grades, credits, titles, etc. so they'll be able to pollute the environment and do anything else as long as the boss tells them to do it. And then they get their rewards. So that's what you want to train them for in school.*
      **** ... *"We have to have accountability!"* and I said "Now that I share the universitie's desire at that level. *We do need to know, whether people have learned, what ... the course involved.* ... *I will give you at the end of the course an instruction, a measurable assessment, of what students could do at the end that they couldn't do at the beginning.* I this respect I'm far more accountable, than a teacher who gives you a C or D. You don't know what that student could do? You will know what each of my students can do at the end what they couldn't do at the beginning." So because of that, I was being more accountable.
    *** I wanna ask you, what about schools and classrooms? Would you think quite logically leads to students to be focused constantly on how well they're doing, besides just grades?
      **** [1:10:00-1:11:05] So *"one size fits all" instruction. Why does everybody read the same book? Why in kindergarden ... are kids doing the same thing? Why do teachers prepare a syllabus in high school or college for kids that they've never met?* +
      *What they're saying is: "Who you are as my students is irrelevant! I've already planned this course. I don't care who you are or what interests you" which might lead to this focus ... just on achievement [instead of learning]. Process of elimination.*

      *I'm absolutely sure that some day people are going to look back at us now, and they're going to say: "What were those people thinking? Why on earth did they ever believe that coersion is essential for education? That's like believing you have to force people to eat, or you have to force people to breathe. Why on earth did they ever think that standardization so that people regardless of their interest, regardless of their predilections, should all learn the same thing? In the same way? Be tested by the same test? What kind of crazy idea is that? I'm sure that we'll reach the day that people will look back and say that. I hope we reach that day sooner rather than later. I would like to see it come in my lifetime. And I hope that some of you, maybe really all of you, I hope, will play a role in bringing that time about before too long."* [I cried at this at Fri Nov  6 09:01:39 PM CET 2020] +

  ** 1:13:57-1:21:53
    *** There are two key underlying premises I've identified that I think drive this overachievement fanaticism:
    . *BGUTI - "Better Get Used To It"* [acronym]
      **** Effects of presence of grades [on average]:
        . Less interest in the task
        . If given a choice pick the easiest possible task
        . Think in a more supreficial fashion +
      **** To the best of my knowledge, every study that has ever looked at the effect of grades, as opposoed to no grades, has found a *diminuition in intrinsic motivation to learn*. The research is very clear. *This research goes from early elementary to university.* +
       +
      *There is litelary no excuse for turning what [people] do into a letter or number.* [1:15:51]
    . *"Harder is better" - The Cult of Rigor* [1:18:05]
      **** assumption or prejudice that a more difficult task, test or teacher is necessarily a higher quality
      **** If it is too hard, [I feel frustrated and discouraged]. If it is too easy, [I feel bored]. *Optimal difficulty is not the same thing as maximum difficulty.*
      **** Learning vs Rigor [1:21:12-1:21:45]
      **** It's a structural problem. It's not a problem with [people] who push themselves too hard. And the schools [and companies] who matter, take that responsibility for [the environment they create for their members in order to support their learning, well-being and responsibility].
  ** 1:21:54-1:23:51
    *** *Tests*
      **** measure what matters least. [reference to Meritocracy, Daniel Markovits]
      **** [Terific teachers] by various criteria have in common that they almost never gave tests because:
        . Tests don't measure stuff that matters [interest in learning, depth of thinking, prefernce for challenge] +
        If the teacher needs to give a test, the teacher needs help in learning how to teach. +
        . Tests [tend] create more anxiety and this kind of achievement pressure.
  ** 1:23:51-1:28:50
    *** *Homework*
      **** No study, to the best of my knowledge, has ever found any benefit to any kind of homework below the highschool level. And increasingly newer studies are raising questions about, wheter homework is necessary even in high school.
      **** The arguments behind homework:
        . BGUTI - "They're going to destroy your evening in the high school, start making you miserable right now!"
        . "It teaches self-discipline, independence, responsibility, good work habits." - An urban myth
    *** Homework is literally all pain and no gain [mainly in the elemantary schools]. *What it [is likely to] produce is frustration, exhaustion, family conflict and nagging, less time for [people] to do stuff they care about when they get home, and lost of interest.* +
     +
    *Homework may be the greatest extinguisher of curiosity yet invented.*
    *** "When I stopped giving homework, a lot of the kids started to coming in and showing me articles for the newspaper they've seen that recapitulated some of the themes from the history we've been learning. That never happened when I gave them homework." It wasn't just disadvantageous. *It was intellectually advantageous to get rid of homework.*
    *** *6 hour of academics is [likely to be] enough*
    *** *What right does the school have to interfere with what family is doing during family time through homework?* except in very rare occasions
 ** 1:28:50-1:33:53
  *** Talk to your kids [and other people] ... about what they are learning [or working] ..., never how well their teacher [or boss] thinks they're learning it [or working].
  *** *The absence of grades and indifference towards grades increased the engagement in what we're learning.* ... *The good you've done by removing grades [or points and other measures] from the occasion, and from the trust you've shown to the [poeple] far outweights the advantages of grades [which are advantageous mainly for the teachers in the process of evaluation and elimination].*

* ... because if I persuade you that something ... you're doing with kids is getting in the way, not what I happen to like, but of your own long-term goals for other people then either you have to rethink the practice or you have to rethink the outcome. +

  ** when teachers don’t seem to have a real connection with their students, or when they don’t seem to care much about them, students are more inclined to cheat. +
  link:https://www.alfiekohn.org/article/whos-cheating/[5: See the research conducted with undergraduates and high school students by Gregory Schraw, Lori Olafson, Fred Kuch, Trish Lehman, Stephen Lehman, and Matthew T. McCrudden, “Interest and Academic Cheating,” in Psychology of Academic Cheating, edited by Eric M. Anderman and Tamera B. Murdock (Burlington, MA: Elsevier Academic Press, 2007)]
  ** Grades, however, are just the most common manifestation of a broader tendency on the part of schools to value product more than process, results more than discovery, achievement more than learning.   If students are led to focus on how well they’re doing more than on what they’re doing, they may do whatever they think is necessary to make it look as though they’re succeeding. Thus, a recent study of more than 300 students in two California high schools confirmed that the more classrooms drew attention to students’ academic performance, the more students “observed and engaged in various types of cheating.”[11]
  ** There was less cheating when [the teachers] made it clear that the point was to enjoy the learning, when understanding mattered more than memorizing, and when mistakes were accepted as a natural result of exploration.[13] link:https://www.alfiekohn.org/article/whos-cheating/[Alfie Kohn - Who's Cheating Whom, paragraph 11], link:https://montessoritraining.blogspot.com/2013/09/montessoris-three-levels-of-obedience.html[Mistakes - Montessori]
  ** How, then, do students develop certain goals?  What leads them to display an interest in what they’re doing as opposed to a concern about how well they’re doing it? ... To lose sight of that fact, that environment [dataset for neural network] is decisive in determining how pervasive cheating will be [15], by condemning the kids who cheat and ignoring the context is to fall into the trap that Lee Ross warned us about, of the trap of fundamental attribution error.
  ** A *competitive school is to cheating as a warm, moist environment is to mold* ... *Competition is the ultimate example of focusing on performance rather than on learning*, so it’s no wonder that *“cheating qualifies as part of* the unhealthy legacy that results from *having tied one’s sense of worth to achieving competitively,” as the eminent psychologist Martin Covington* explained. ... How ironic, then, that *some of the adults who most vociferously deplore cheating also support competitive practices – and confuse competitiveness with excellence [Excellence vs Superiority - Daniel Markovits]* – with the result that cheating is more likely to occur.
  ** *Schools then become*, in the words of educational historian David Labaree, *“a vast public subsidy for private ambition,” places where “self-interested actors [seek] opportunities for gaining educational distinctions at the expense of each other.” And if the point is just to get ahead,* he continues, *individuals may seek “to gain the highest grade with the minimum amount of learning.” Cheating could be seen as a rational choice in a culture of warped values.* link:https://books.google.sk/books/about/How_to_Succeed_in_School_Without_Really.html?id=_8UXjg_PJtUC&redir_esc=y[David F.

  ** What he had in mind, presumably, was helping students to learn as well as to take pleasure in doing so.  And detecting or deterring cheating more effectively, as one language arts teacher explains, fails to address the “educational damage” caused by whatever systemic forces have taught students that “the final product takes precedence over learning.” link:http://web.mit.edu/21w.784/www/BD%20Supplementals/Materials/Unit%20Two/Plagiarism/cut-n-paste%20ethics.pdf[Lisa Renard, “Cut and Paste 101:   Plagiarism and the Net,”]
  ** Rebecca Moore Howard, who teaches writing at Syracuse University, put it this way: “In our stampede to fight what some call a ‘plague’ of plagiarism, we risk becoming the enemies rather than the mentors of our students; we are replacing the student-teacher relationship with the criminal-police relationship. . . .Worst of all, we risk not recognizing that our own pedagogy needs reform. . . [if it] encourages plagiarism because it discourages learning.”[32]

    *** Reflecting on "good" education and parenting with question "What are your long term goals for your students and children?" Then we work backwards from the answers on this question, which sets goals for the "good" education and parenting. And the best kind of education is not certainly not one, that sets kids against other kids in a competition for medals and other artificially scarce distinctions that leads them to view everyone else as obstacles to their own success. +
     +
    *Other people are potential obstacles to your success.* +
    link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qRZt0VCak[Alfie Kohn at the OFJCC: Performance vs. Learning - The Costs of Overemphasizing Achievement: 47:00-47:18] +
     +
    A "good" education is not one that raises scores on exams that are merely about cramming forgettable facts into short term memory. *A good school is one where the students have a lot to say about the curriculum and the pedagogy which means what they're being taught and how they're being taught. A really good school is one that's* not just *about* memorizing facts and practicing skills, but *understanding ideas from inside out. A really good school is one where students feel a part of a caring community.* They don't feel alone or lonely, or worse, set against others in a contest.
  ** 3:24-4:03
    *** What looks like a question of a parental motivation, quickly reveals itself to be a question about *"What's wrong with traditional education?" The best schools around the world do not make students to commit this kind of stuff to memory that could be looked up on a computer or phone. They are doing a very different kind of education at the first place. The kind that is trully authentically engaging where students are inclined to pursue meaningful projects of their own design that help them to think more carefully about questions that matter.*
  ** 5:45-8:50
    *** A lot of young adults are not busy thanking their parents for having compell them do things they held no interest in them. What those young people are doing is thinking *"Why did you destroy my childhood in search of trying to get me toward a goal of making more money in the future?"* ... We want our children to earn a living. But that's very different from sacrificing happiness, morality, interest in learning, critical thinking, and so on, to the goal of making a lot of money, because you and I both know, that an awful lot of people who are affluent, are also miserable, and many of them are not particulary ethical human beings. Conversely, a lot of the people I most respect, and are most content in their lives, are not earning a lot of money. Education isn't a means to an end, even when the end is merely wealth in their adulthood. *We want to help them fall in love with thinking, with asking deep critical questions and being creative.* ... *so they come to understand the idea and learn to think like scientists. That's how you learn when you don't have to bribe or threathen kids into doing the activities, and you certainly don't have to see math as just a way to make more money when you're older.*
  ** 10:17-11:15
    *** Generative questions help people become thinkers. They generate ideas, and make learning something worth doing, as opposed to whipping people into doing whatever meaningless garbage they're told to do, is actively undermining the intellectual development, and putting a strain on our relationships. Parents are involved in the kid's intellectual development, but that doesn't mean that they want to become an enforcer of school rules, regulations and demands, that turn out not to be good for kids in the first place.
  ** 11:27-14:31
    *** Grades and tests tell us the least interesting things about the peoples's intellectual development. If people come home chattering excitedly about something they've figured out how to do that day in school [or in work], that's an excellent sign. If people together continue debating a topic after the school [or work] is over, that's a good sign. If kids not only can read, but choose to read on their own time, that's an excellent sign. If people are asking themselves increasingly sofisticated questions about ideas, and seen genuinely engaged in figuring things out, these are good signs about the kind of education people are getting. And they are also good signs about the progress that people are making intellectually. If you refer to grades instead, that my child get an 8 this time, instead of a 4, that's very worrysome. Because what research tells us about grades or marks, is that there are 3 reliable effects on getting students to focus on improving their grades:
    . Kids become less interested in learning instead.
      **** To the best of my knowledge, every study that has looked on this question, has found a negative effect on people's interest in learning [or working] as a result of being focust on their marks.
    . People tend to pick the easiest possible task when you give them a choice.
      **** Not because the're lazy or unmotivated, but because they're rational. The people say "Duh! Of course! If the goal is to get a higher grade [or a higher test score], I'm going to pick the shortest book, or the easiest project, or a topic that I already know something about where I don't have much to learn." Because the goal of getting a better grade is the antithesis, the opposit of taking intellectual risks.
    . People tend to think in a superficial, or shallow fashion
      **** They're less likely to ask questions like "How do we know that's true?" or "Doesn't that contradict what we were learning last week?", and instead they're more likely to ask questions like "Do we have to know this?", "Is this gonna be on the exam?". And then you've lost them as learnens. +
      As a parent of a child that goes to a "traditional" school that is still using grades, my job, as a parent, is to make grades as invisible as possible for as long as possible. To ignore the numbers that the schools are still "stupidly" giving out, and encourage people to think about ideas instead. +
      If I'm a teacher teaching in a school like that, I never would put a numerical grade on any individual project or task that kids do, so that I can help kids to forget about grades and engage with ideas until the end when I will give them one.
  **  14:47-17:33
    *** [Grades, points or credits] are not a genuine indication of human's capacities. First of all, most kids already have a sense from when engaging in a task what they have trouble with and what they do more easily without any feedback from a teacher. They know that they are having trouble reading, or they solved a problem or come up with an experiment in science quickly. They don't need a grade for that. Although there are some times when they require informational feedback from a teacher. First of all, grades [points or credits] are not a feedback. They're not an [meaningful] information. They're a judgement. They say "I think I like what you do or how well you do this particular task." Secondly, there are authentic forms of assessment where students actually do something to show what they understand about an idea, and have the teacher offer responses or even have other students offer responses about where they may need some help to improve. Never does this require reducing people into numerical [or alphabetical] term. What that does leads to the 3 effects that I've just mentioned, without providing any useful information that they couldn't get more informative and less destructive with other forms of feedback. Maybe a kid can translate something that did by themselves into a foreign language, or picking a situation from a real life and learning from it. Then we are not only learning more authentically, than just memorizing facts in the short term memory. What the teacher is getting information about how well I'm learning it without ever having to give a test or a grade [or points]. And they can share in a conversation or in a paragraph of a narrative report, with the student, how things are going. *"Good" teachers never need a test to get a sense of how well the people are learning, and they never need a grade to report the quality of learning to anybody.*

    *** The research overwhelmingly shows that competition holds people back from doing their best work as adults in the workplace, and holds them back from the most effective learning in a classroom, and isn't necessary to have a good time in recreation and play, and is terribly destructive psychologically for people as well. We live in cultures that have turned competition, the idea of being "number one" (#1), and defeating other people, into practically a state religion. And it turns out, that:
      . it's bad for people psychologically, when you constatly feeling "I'm not good enough because there are always more people I have to beat."
      . it's very bad for our relationships because competition creates envy of winners and contempt for losers, and aggression, hostility and rivalry, it undermines helpfulness, trust and open communication. Competition is completely different from excellence [Excellence vs Superiority distinction by Daniel Markovits]. Study after study shows that if I'm thinking about how I have to beat other people at work, at school, at home, at play [at games], I'm not able to do the best job that I'm capable. Because now the task is seen as just something I have to get through, in order to get [this cookie, this goodie] a trophy, to get recognition, be seen as "number one". And I'm not able to draw from the skills and knowledge from the people around me. Real excellence comes from cooperation when all of us try to learn or produce something together. But if those people have to be defeated, in order for me to succeed, because that's what competition means, then I'm certainly not gonna help them, they're not gonna help me, and all of us end up losing in the race to win.
  ** 20:48-end
    *** Test scores are lousy measures. Standardized tests measure what matters least about actual learning. Standardized test scores are largely a matter of socioeconomic status where richer countries and richer neighborhoods do better on those tests. So a low score is not necessarily a bad sign, and a high score is not necessarily a good sign. And the worst thing to do is think of it in relative terms as a competition, when we as ourselves "How do we compare to other countries?" That is I think a morally bankrupt question. We want people all over Europe and the world to learn effectively. We don't want to look upon other countries in order to say "We're number one!" as if it's a football game or something. Education is not a contest. Therefore, I would for many reasons ignore the score. When you asking people about their experiences about the education, the answers may be valid and important. Anwers by the people who feel lonely and unhappy with their educational experience, may be the best answers to the question "What's wrong with ["traditional education"] grades, tests, homework, competition?" The answer is you're destroying the people and children because you don't understand how counterproductive those practices are. Maybe that's what they're telling us. And maybe the place to start is by actively asking people more often about their experience in school, and helping them to bring them in on the process of changing the education. based on the experience of the people we're educating. If they're feeling lonely, unhappy, isolated [discouraged from attempts for inclusion, cooperation, importance and changing of current rules] and alienated [i.e. when they feel unpleasant when they feel frustrated from the failing attempts to integrate themselves to the community and don't see the meaning in the tasks they're doing], they cannot learn effectively, even when they have the best curriculum and pedagogy available, which apparently they don't. It doesn't only make sense to me to create a better education system for people we want to educate. It makes more sense to me to create a better education system with people we want to educate. Because people are most likely to flourish, be happy, and succceed, when they have something to say about what it is they're doing every day.

* We would like to think that school is a place for children to develop their curiosity, love for learning, passions for what they want to pursue, creativity, critical thinking, all these wonderful things, but we're stuck because of history with *the school system that was developed to suppress those things deliberately, not to promote those things.* And you really *can't use that system that was developed for obedience, indoctrination and obedience training to do these other things!* *No way can you expect to have 20 or 30 kids in a room all doing the same thing because they're curious!* ... *No way could you deal with critical thinking if they all begin to criticise the lessons you're teaching!* ... *We've got a system that was well designed for indoctrination and obedience training, and it's still good at that!* Even when that's not what we're trying to do.

* *Homo economicus* - Other critics of the homo economicus model of humanity, such as Bruno Frey, point to the excessive emphasis on extrinsic motivation (rewards and punishments from the social environment) as opposed to intrinsic motivation [not internal!]. For example, it is difficult if not impossible to understand how homo economicus would be a hero in war or would get inherent pleasure from craftsmanship. Frey and others argue that too much emphasis on rewards and punishments can "crowd out" (discourage) intrinsic motivation: paying a boy for doing household tasks may push him from doing those tasks "to help the family" to doing them simply for the reward. +
Another weakness is highlighted by economic sociologists and anthropologists, who argue that homo economicus ignores an extremely important question, i.e. the origins of tastes and the parameters of the utility function by social influences, training, education, and the like. The exogeneity of tastes (preferences) in this model is the major distinction from homo sociologicus, in which tastes are taken as partially or even totally determined by the societal environment (see below). +
Further critics[citation needed], learning from the broadly defined psychoanalytic tradition, criticize the homo economicus model as ignoring the inner conflicts that real-world individuals suffer, as between short-term and long-term goals (e.g., eating chocolate cake and losing weight) or between individual goals and societal values. Such conflicts may lead to "irrational" behavior involving inconsistency, psychological paralysis, neurosis, and psychic pain. Further irrational human behaviour can occur as a result of habit, laziness, mimicry and simple obedience. +
The emerging science of "neuroeconomics" suggests that there are serious shortcomings in the conventional theories of economic rationality.[16] Rational economic decision making has been shown to produce high levels of cortisol, epinephrine and corticosteroids, associated with elevated levels of stress. It seems that the dopaminic system is only activated upon achieving the reward, and otherwise the "pain" receptors, particularly in the pre-frontal cortex of the left hemisphere of the brain show a high level of activation.[17] Serotonin and oxytocin levels are minimised, and the general immune system shows a level of suppression. Such a pattern is associated with a generalised reduction in the levels of trust. Unsolicited "gift giving", considered irrational from the point of view of homo-economicus, by comparison, shows an elevated stimulation of the pleasure circuits of the whole brain, reduction in the levels of stress, optimal functioning of the immune system, reduction in cortico-steroids and epinephrine and cortisol, activation of the substantia nigra, the striatum and the nucleus acumbens (associated with the placebo effect), all associated with the building of social trust. Mirror neurons result in a win-win positive sum game in which the person giving the gift receives a pleasure equivalent to the person receiving it.[18] This confirms the findings of anthropology which suggest that a "gift economy" preceded the more recent market systems where win-lose or risk-avoidance lose-lose calculations apply.[19] +

  ** 0:17-2:44
    *** *Collaboration is a voluntary activity that starts with togetherness, shared purpose and willingness to come up with a joint strategy. Collaboration means constantly adapting to our differences.* If that's true then structures that we have in the world are fundamentally opposed to that happening. Within the context of *competition* it is incredibly difficult to create collaboration. [We assume scarce resources, not that it will be enough for everyone.] Because competition, by definition, means individuals against each other, or teams against each other, or always something against something else. 
  ** 3:24-4:05
    *** *Competition is one obstacle to collaboration. The other one is the structure of command and control.* Our current structures have *competition horizontally [among people at the same position in a hierarchy]* and *command and control vertically [from top to bottom, among different levels in a hierarchy]*. There is some competition between levels [when we deal with promotions].
  ** 4:53-
    *** How command and control interferes with collaboration? If I am in power, you are less likely to speak truthfully to me. If you don't speak truthfully to me, we don't collaborate. There are 4 things that you are less likely to tell me if you have less power:
    **** *Your needs*. Because the needs of the powerful, the ones on the top in a hierarchical structure, are prioritized.
    **** (7:26) *Your perspective on things*, when a decision is dictated on you from above, and you have no say about it. It creates lack of trust and apathy.
    **** (8:43) *Your creativity*. There is a myth that wisdom emerges from universities and the more elite the university, the more wisdom you have. [intellectual vs emotional wisdom]. Wisdom in sharing and mutual aid of people living in poverty.
    **** (10:24-13:53) *Your 'No'*. Having power means you rarely hear no [or descent]. That increases the likelihood that we're going to create unsustainable agreements. Because if you can't say 'No', you can't say 'Yes'. We can only say 'Yes' [or agree] when we can say 'No' [or say what keeps us from saying 'Yes']. I believe that most broken agreements are broken because they have never been entered in the first place. Do your children, your students, your colleagues, people around you, ever have a true option to say 'No' to whatever agreement you proposed? [Without responding with power over tactics?] Deciding together. Power sharing [distributed power].

    *** Why do we even want to collaborate? What do we gain from collaboration?
      **** creativity - diversity of thinking based on different needs
      **** increasing sense of power among individuals in the grouphave the power to make changes

    *** *If I am part of creating the strategy that we're going to carry out I am more likely to be committed to carrying it out. If [somebody else] decides what's gonna happen and I just have to carry it out, and I was not part of somehow coming up with the design, I'm less [intrinsically] motivated [because now the meaning of the activity is clearer]. ... There is more energy to a project if it's done collaboratively than when it's dictated from above.

    *** Every time we make a request, we ask two questions; first question gets asked out loud: it's the request - the request is an opportunity for someone to make the life of the other person more wonderful by mutualy fulfilling their needs; the other question gets asked silently, internaly, but carries much more emotional weight: *"Do I matter to you?"*, *"Do you care about me?"*, *Am I important to you?* which serves to fulfil *the need of importance, the need to matter*. If I say "No" to the first question, and the other person who asked the question doesn't have the consciousness about empathy and "no" being a poor expression of a yes, or dogging for the needs, then the other person takes the "no" as the answer to the latter question: "So I don't matter to you." I may think I got an adequate answer. But in the end the relationship suffers, because we are in a permanent defficit around the need to matter. But we may feel vunlerable wenn we talk about the need to matter, to be important, because of our gender roles, education and other outside influences. Our dignity depends on our need to matter.

    "We have the first version of the proposal. Now is the time to express any concern that you have. Small or large, it doesn't matter. Right now we are going to discuss all the remarks that are brought up [in order to adjust the proposal by these remarks in the next version]. *Does someone has any concerns [or remarks] about this proposal?*" +
    In the next version I will increase the level of descent, by asking a question: +
    *It looks like we considered all mentioned remarks. But we still want you to ask you if you still have some objections about this proposal. Do you have any significant doubts or concerns about this proposal that you believe would interfere with us working well? Please, express them. But otherwise, if it's something small, that time is over.* +
    In the next version I increase the level of descent again: +
    *Okay, everything is prepared. Is here somebody who would like to leave the community if we adopt this proposal?* +
    *By then you established so much trust, that if there is something like this, people will articulate it. Otherwise the people will recognize that we've done the best that we can to make it work for everyone.*

    *** An organisation never says 'no'. It's always a human being, an individual, that say's 'no'. [And 'no' is a poor expression of a 'yes'. What is it that the someone says 'yes' to?] *And if you can think about why person is saying 'no', you're already moving towards the possibility of collaborating.*

If the model will work only for one of these groups, and those models will go nowhere, because we lack collectively the power to make them happen, and because ultimately if we do them, they will recreate the world that we have now even if we had the power. ... So creating something that works for both ends to me creates a robustness that could make it work, but mostly *there is a way that people who are committed to communities don't think about the individuals that are in the [institution] as something to consider. That is perhaps a reason why they're saying 'No'. I don't see that we can get anywhere collaboratively, in a way that will create a different world, without taking into consideration the reality.* That unless you have global mass mobilization, that creates defection from the implicit support that the institutions and government have, you have to reckon with the power [over people].

    *** How we can break with that? ... There is a principle that ultimately work is meaningful if it helps people and improves other people's lives. Thus caring labor has become the paradigm for all forms of labor. ... I think, a lot of economics is really theological. It's a transposition of old religious ideas about creation where human beings and human condition, our fallen state, is one where God is the creator, we tried to usurp his position, so God punishes us by saying "Okay, you can create your own lives, but it's gonna be miserable and painful." *So work is both productive, it's creative, but at the same time, it's also supposed to be suffering [Work is supposed to be suffering - Miki Kashtan]. So we have an idea that work is productivity.* ... Our paradigm for value is production. But if you think about it, most work is not productive. Most work is about maintaining things, it's about care, ... caring about other people. 
    .  First of all *we need to think of working classes not as producers, but as carers. People who take care of other people. And always have been.* Psychological studies show that the poorer you are, the better you are at reading other peoples emotions and understanding what they're feeling. That's because it's the job of people to take care of others. Rich people don't have to think about are feeling. Literally. *We need to redefine working classes as caring classes.*
    . Second of all we need to move away from a paradigm of production and consumption because we're gonna save the planet. We really need to move away from productivism. I would just propose that we just rip up the discipline of economics as it exists and start over. *We need to replace the ideas of production and consumption with care and freedom.* Even if you're making a bridge, you make a bridge because you care about the people can get across the river. You make a car because you care that people can get around. Even production  is a one subordinate type of care. What we do as human beings we take care of each other. Care is closely related to the notion of freedom because care is normally defined as answering to other peoples needs. But it's not just that. It's more that that. Why, for example, a prison isn't a caregiving institution, whereas something else might be? If you think about care, what is the paradigm for caring relations between a mother and a child? A mother, or a parent, takes care of a child, so that the child can grow, and be healthy and flourish. But on an immediate level, *you take care of a child [or somebody/something] so the child can go and play [Peter Gray]*. That's what children actually do when you're taking care of them. *What is play? Play is an action done for its own sake [Flow - The activity is autotelic]. It's in a way the very paradigm for freedom* because action done for its own sake is what freedom really consists of. *Play and freedom are ultimately the same thing.* A production-consumption paradigm for what an economy is, is a guarantee for ultimately destroying the planet and and each other. We need to break away from from the paradigm of degrowth entirely as well. *Care and freedom on the other hand you can increase as much as you like without damaging anything. We need to think what are ways that we can care for each other that will make each other more free. And who are the people who are providing the care, and how can they be compensated of greater freedom? And to do that we need to actually scrap almost all of the discipline of economics as it currently exists.* Because economics as it currently exists is based on assumptions of human nature that we now know that are wrong. There have been actual empirical tests of the basic fundamental assumption on the maximizing individualism that economic theory is based on and it turns out, they're not true. It tells you something about the role of economics. This has had almost not effect on econonmic teaching whatsoever. They don't really care that it's not true. But one of the things that we have discovered, which is quite interesting, is that human beings have a psychological need to be cared for, but they have even greater psychological need to care for others, or to care for something. If you don't have that, you basically fall apart. That's why [old] people get dogs. We don't just care for each other because we want to mantain each other's lives and freedoms, but our own very psychological happiness is based on being able to care about something or someone. What would happen to microeconomics if we started from [the paradigm of care, freedom and play]. Museum of care - Rojava. Because at the moment the system of value that we have is set up in such a way that this kind of trap [or contradiction - David Harvey] that I've described and the gradual bullshittization of employment we're essentialy production work as become value onto itself in such way that we're literally destroying the planet. And in order to actually reimagine a type of economics that wouldn't destroy the planet, we have to start all over again.

The system depends on entrepreneurs raising money to start their businesses, and the companies being allowed to fail, if they cannot make a profit. As it has grown private ownership of companies has evolved into ownership by large scale financial institutions which pool the savings of many different investors of capital. +

    *** We've all got this idea that everybody should be working all the time because it's wrong for people to get something for nothing [because someone who doesn't work doesn't *deserve* anything good].

    *** One of the things that emerged from my research is that there seems to be a general rule that *the more your work actually and obviously benefits other human beings, the less they're going to pay you to do it. So the more useless or even harmful your job, the more you get paid, and the more respect and social status you get from having it.* There is nothing more useful as a garbage collector, but you don't get treated that well. So people would have the situation where [they say] "Here I am. My family considers me to be as the most successful member, I put a suit, I go to work every day. But secretly I know that I work in a firm with three times as many managers as workers. We're all there sitting and starring at each other. What do I make of this? Do I tell other people? Do I tell my co-workers? Does my supervisor actually know that I'm not doing anything?" People are haunted by this phenomena. And the fact that they're treated of such respect and paid so much actually made it worse. So people have feelings of guilt, anxiety, depression, they start to treat each other very badly in the workplaces. A lot of people would say that "The more pointless the job, the more people scream at each other, and mistreat each other, and bully each other." So these are office jobs. They're well respected, but they're pointless. And they seem to be a huge increasing sector of economy.

You have all these people who know to be pointless, and then there's jobs that people don't know they're pointless because they're in support of pointless work.

If that was the case, what would happen to global warming if we suddenly reduced all the work by 50%. We would save the planet. [I recommend quitting a bullshit job.] Think of all the psychological damage, all the depression, all the anxiety, people report terrible symptoms. You'd have much happier population. You would have a population that could start doing... think of all the art and culture people would produce if they had some time on their hands. ... Even if 10% of all jobs would disappear, that would make a BIG difference in terms of in terms of general health and well-being.*

    *** [My preferred solution to solving the problem of bullshit jobs is to give people an] *universal basic income (UBI). I think we need to separate work and livelihood.* I think everyone should receive a livelihood. Everyone should be guaranteed the basic means for a minimally comfortable life. And after that it's up to you. Because the only reason anybody's sitting there in the job where they're not doing anything all day long, just like taking one phone call a day and pretending to work, is because they need the money to pay the rent. [I believe that] nobody's gonna take these [bullshit] jobs if they have a basic income. ... A basic income would have to be enough money to pay the rent. It would be enough to live on. ... People say "I want to do something useful, but they won't pay anything to do it." So I think people will do things that are useful. And if they don't pay them that much, it's okay, because it'll be on top of the money [of universal basic income] they already have. ... Unfortunately, a lot of pilots [of UBI] are very limited. But the ones that I've seen from India and Namibia are quite promising. I think, there's left-wing and right-wing versions of basic income, and I should emphasize that everything depends on whether it is used to expand or to contract what I call *the zone of unconditionality*. The right-wing version is "Let's give them money, and get rid of free healthcare." I'm not saying that. I'm saying, we need to expand the zone of what you get unconditionaly because you're alive. Expand it from things like education and health which you should still have, to things like the means to pay your rent and eat. But I think that it's very important that it be universal. That there's a principle, that everybody [receives this unconditionality]. ... If you think about [the idea of universal basic income], even a lot of capitalists are starting to think about it because they realize that there is a problem. If they have automation to the point where they don't have any workers anymore, who's gonna buy their stuff?
  ** 1:09:53-1:10:21 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R07TlNqz9X4&feature=youtu.be&t=4193
    *** *And who's going to pay the basic income?* There we get to my other book about money [Debt: The first 5000 years]. Money is not something that isn't a limited supply unless you want it to be. *Money is created by banks by making loans.* Money is easy. *Money is a bunch of promisses we make to each other. We can make as much [money] as we like.*
  ** 1:18:42-1:22:19 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R07TlNqz9X4&feature=youtu.be&t=4722
    *** *How could we design a system in which everyone, even the people in bullshit jobs, will value jobs, that provide care for other people? Isn't that a bigger problem than the existence of the jobs?* I would say yes. I aggree with you very strongly on that. I think that universal basic income is a policy. But what we need is a fundamental moral and conceptual revolution about "What is the value of work?" And we need to move away from a notion of production which is very patriachal, and back to the notion of caring labor as the fundamental form of value creation. Most work isn't about producing anything. Most work is about maintaining and taking care of things. I always say "You make a cup once, but you wash it a thousand times." Work is about maintaining things, keeping things nice, keeping them the same, taking care of animals, people, plants, things, buildings. And that's what people actually do. Take care of each other and the environment. And I think, if we start from that, and come up with a conception of value, that is the primary form of value, then that would be a society that would make sense. And the more we have computers taking care of actual production, the more makes sense that where value comes from. Because it's not just that AI, robots and computers can do production better, it's also, probably they can do caring labor, but you don't want them to do that. This is the kind of labor that you want people to be doing. You want to be freed up from drudgery so that we can take care of each other. And that's the kind of society we want. But the question is, it's very difficult politically. I actually coined the phrase "revolt of the caring classes" as what we need. But in the way it's starting to happen. I feel that in the Occupy was in a way the first sturrings of this revolt. If you look at the people, especially the people, who couldn't come to the Occupation to express the support of the "We are the 99%" Thumblr page, overwhelming majority were in what I would call the caring professions: health, education, social services. And they all said the same thing: "I wanted to have a job where I could benefit other people. At least I wasn't hurting them. And when you want to do something to care for others, they put you so deeply in debt, they give you so little money that you can't even take care of your own family, your own children. This is ridiculous." And that was the real cry and outrage that drove the movement. If you look at strike movements around the world, in England it is professors and junior doctors, in America you have teacher strikes all over the place, in France the carehome workers went on strike for the first time in the french history.

    *** I don't know, I'd like to see them try. ... *The American political system is created to make it as difficult as possible for that to happen.* ... I think that political parties serve a propaganda purpose more than anything else because it's almost impossible for political parties to gain that [control] of the entire system. ... You have to remember that the political structure that we ehave is a structure that was created to prevent democracy. This is what people don't remember. I always like to annoy people by pointing out that nowhere in the link:https://www.britannica.com/topic/Declaration-of-Independence/Text-of-the-Declaration-of-Independence[Declaration of Independence] or the link:https://usconstitution.net/const.pdf[Constitution] they say anything about America being a democracy. People who wrote these documents hated democracy, they were utterly against it. I remember a quote from John Adams who was very explicit: "Majority vote? We can't have majority vote. The person that will do it will abolish the debts and redistribute the land." They set up the system to, basically, prevent [direct] democracy and then we named it democracy because people got elected on that platform and so suddenly everybody was a democrat. But it's a system really designed to make it as difficult as possible for democratic voices to work through the system. Even before it became a system of constitutionalized bribery.

    *** I think that the thing about Bookchin that I would add, is that Bookchin ... has the tendency to dichotomize. He'll just say "One is completely good, the other is completely bad." ...Bookchin kind of goes one way. ... So, there is an inherent flaw in the system which allows him to create a purism which would never actually exist if people really started doing this. [Looks to me like fascism - internal cleansing and purification, external expansion, only one way to do things. I'm very concerned about this...] *I think that what we would end up is a system of much more heterogenous than anything that these abstract theorists invision*. A lot of problems that will arise when you have contracting principles an you want to square them in some reasonable fashion, *although we can't imagine it right now.* But these are really thought experiments.

    *** I don't think the relation to nature and environmental issue in the end is a technical problem. It's, I think, an aesthethic, social and very human problem. That to degree to which we view nature and the natural world is purely instrumental to our own needs. We've become alienated from it. And this leads into the last notion which is the *universal alienation* which attaches to the fact that capital through commodity production defines condition of alienation. And that condition of alienation becomes the ore universal, the deeper the capital roots itself in social change [*internalized capitalism* - the more you internalize... - Pierce Delahunt]. It's very hard to think these days of meaningful jobs. It's hard to construct a meaningful life. And, I think, the loss of meaning which has come about through the new technologies of the labour process, through the new technologies of consumption, that the loss of meaning becomes in itself a destabilizing factor in a way in which the world works.

    *** *We're all capitalists. ... We're all embedded within the contradictions of capital. [At the moment we can at least] say "I'm on this side of the contradiction, rather than that side of the contradiction." And we can push things in various directions.* We've been through thirty years pushing things one direction, we need a big hefty push to other directions. *I cannot escape the contradictions that surround us.* And I think that's a part where "The 17 Contradictions [of Capitalism]" is to me a very important book because it actually displays what the contradictions are, where the contradictions are that you live with, and what positionality you may want to take politically in relationship to these contradictions.

    *** People in Brazil in 2013 revolted against state because state spent money on megaprojects instead of improving daily life of the citizens.
    *** *Why is it that worldwide we're building cities for people to invest in, not for people to live in?* This principle applies worldwide, in cities like Dubai, Mumbai, Santiago, Sao Paolo, China ... I don't know a single city where that's not going on. Then you ask the question "Why is this going on in this particular way?" At that point, you get back to the contradictions of capital and you see why. The only way capital can get out of its contradictions right now is to do things like that [to stimulate growth -  that's what capitalism is based on]. An if the only kind of urbanization produces that, we need to do something different.
  ** 1:54:02-2:00:36 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnWG0KpMnms&feature=youtu.be&t=6842
    *** *I'm a great believer with the idea that all politics begins in a locality. [Politics] beginns with personal, daily life.* And I don't think you can have any politics that is not rooted in daily life questions. Which is why I want to talk about the politics of realization. Because that's where people feel it. Clearly. And everybody feels in a houshold, not just the person who's working, but everybody. The kids. Everybody. But that will be scaled up in some way. ... You begin with the personal as political [Aaah, so that's where the *repolitization* comes from...]. And it's the personal response to daily life conditions which is political. *But it scales up. People come together in a factory, institutions, neighborhood, communities, and so on, so you move to a different level. So my personal politics and anger what the landlords are doing are similar to my neighbour. So there is another level which you may call a neighborhood level.* There're many different neighbourhoods. And alliances form between neighbourhoods. And people start to talk about the qualities of urban life of the city as a whole. Anarchist are very good at mobilizing in the neighborhood. They're not very good at talking how to organize a city as a whole. Water supplies, food supplies, garbage collection, sewage. Taking care of these things on a bio-regional basis. What are the ways to do that? And how do we set up an organizational form to do that? I'm talking about hierarchies here. An then the bio-regions fit into what's going on in a whole territory, like a state. *How do you put [the bio-regions] together?* *And there, this confederalism idea is important.* And you will go from all these scales to elsewhere [somewhere even higher, maybe]. So we will have these layers of activity [software layers, design and architectural patterns]. And one of the things that tended to happen is once you move through these different layers, you get a different poliltics. You get a different vision. You see things clearly o na bio-regional level, you don't see another level [data hiding, encapsulation - programming]. And you need a connection and explanation how the politics on the higher level relates to the politics on all other levels. Globally also. We have these issues of global warming, for example. We need to work somehow around those issues. So that the scale then becomes significant. *And as you move from personal to political, you need to remember to include the people on lower layers in order to ask them for feedback, whether the changes actually are helping them, and reaffirm what you're doing. Explain what you're doing on the bio-regional level, to a personal political level. Otherwise your politics gets hollowed out [vydlabaná], it looses its backs, purchase, [trustworthiness and meaning] in daily life.* We can think about these different layers. We can figure out the issues [needs and solutions] around the bio-regional or global level back to us, whether we need to do something in our daily lives, in order to meet a requirement [a need].
    *** I'm not anti-capitalist because I have some defect in my DNA. Nor am I anti-capitalist bacause I've been traumatized by some nasty capitalist who treated me badly and had my mind warped as an infant. I started to read Capital when I was 35 years old. *We can change these things via thoughtful configuration and thoughtful reflection on all these issues is vital for political action, so we understand where we are, what we're doing, and why are we doing it?*

    *** ... but the ususal public attitude ... is "There's nothing you can do with this population." It's like what ... I have been thaught before I first went into the prisons: "These people are untreatable. It's hopeless. Intractable. All you can do is lock them up and throw away the key." That is totally untrue. Another lesson is ... that punishment is not the answer. Although I do think that people who are harming others do need to be isolated from the community and restrained from harming others. I don't believe that throwing away the key and letting everybody out anymore, than locking them up and throwing away the key. Both of those are equally unworkable. When someone is robbing and murdering you've got to protect the public for as long time as they're continuing to be dangerous. But above and beyond that, punishment, that is the [retributive] infliction of further pain, is totally unnecessary once you've made the community safe by putting them behind locked doors. Further pain, which we call punishment, only increases the amount of violence they commit, or will commit in the future, not to mention the violence they commit in the jai or prison. So, I believe in ... restraining people who are hurting other people the same way I believe to restraining a two-year old who's running in front of traffic. If they don't respond to words and stop, you grab them, you put your arms around them, and you pull the back, so they won't get hurt [protective use of force]. But you don't hurt them. The whole point of all of this that they don't get hurt. Unfortunatelly, we've forgotten to treat adults the way we take for granted we would treat children. [I see it working both ways so that we can justify the violence done to children as well.] But adults respond to the same psychology. *The more punitive we are, the more violent society we have.* For example, the most extreme form of punishment is capital punishment.

    *** "Are you suggesting that ther is something inherently objectionable about enjoyment, about joy?" I talk to people about progressive education about *the benefits of giving kids more say about their learning, having them learn excitedly _with_ others, not in competition _against_ others*, only to be informed that "Life isn't always goinna be interesting, or responsive to people's preferences, *and they better deal with that fact now, like it or not*." "Like it or not!" or "It's time they learn ..." are common phrases on the part of people who think this way. The implication being that people [especially kids] should be introduced to frustration and unhappiness without delay. "There's work to be done! Life isn't all fun and games, you know?" [Jackals think of these two possibilities: I must have all the power to force other people to behave, or the other option they think of is permissivness, giving up power and just giving in, letting the children [or the other people] over. M.B. Rosenberg - Resolving CConflicts] This is a deeper level of societie's dislike or mistrust of other people [especially children]. The whole idea of childhood as a time for joy and exploration really rankles people who have a deeply philosophical, and sometimes theological commitment or [even] psychological commitment to making sure that people have the same fear of pleasure and redemption through suffering. *BGUTI [Better Get Used To It] is a way of saying to children "Your objections don't count.

* Can you feel even for one second the beauty of both [needs, the beauty of all unfulfilled needs at both conflict parties]? I want [to fulfill all the needs].

When a human being is fully heard, and has a sense that his needs are being taken seriously, immediately there is a new openness. I learned immediately to think "Shit, what to do?" Then any solution that will come will be like a band-aid on the leg. Try to practice connecting with the needs, not to solve the conflict. Just to connect with the needs and sit there.

* *_Book - James Gilligan - Violence: Our Deadly Epidemic and its Causes_*. +
Every act of violence somewhere is an attempt to create justice to right a wrong that happened before. That wrong may happen two seconds before or might have happened 50 years before. But there's somewhere in the person's deep organism some wrong that have happend that needs to be righted, and the violence is an expression of that. Now we can all understand the pull to justice *but why does it go to violence rather than to other means? Because we feel shame. All the people that he had talked with essentially without exception were carrying boatloads of shame* in them about who they are, about what has happened to them, about what they want, and most particulary, about anything that had to do with tenderness, with any need for love, for connection, for appreciation. They had so much shame about it. One of the things that are so clear coming out of this is that *punishment makes things worse because it increases shame link:https://cassandravoices.com/current-affairs/global/special-report-punitive-policies-inflict-further-exclusion-and-trauma-on-syrian-refugee-children/[[and intensifies trauma response and symptoms]]. If shame is at the root of violence, punishment is not going to work. It only going to make the person get into a deeper loop* about who they are now. "Not only I'm ashamed about everything else, now I'm ashamed about the things that I've done and I've been punished, I've been ostracized, there's no room for me." link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msWYVhmuQhw&feature=youtu.be&t=604[(Albany Addresses Bullying: Miki Kashtan: A Compassionate Perspective on Bullying 3/5/2011: 10:04-12:43)]

* [Shame] is not only now more common, its purpose has shifted from protecting the group [i.e. the community] to protecting the powerful. So *most of us walk around with some degree of shame that is just there in the background that keeps us from doing things.* And *we get shamed for what we want. If you look at early childhood, you are made to be ashamed for wanting what you want, for moving spontaneously, for going for what is of direct interest to you, for saying what is true for you, everything that is about being you is put into question.* ... This is why I decided to become 100% shameless. Why is this funny? Because the word _shameless_ describes someone who is a terrible person, totally outside of the norm. It's as if we're told that having a certain amount of shame, constatly, is a good thing. link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mErG7mSzwkc&feature=youtu.be&t=2029[Miki Kashtan - Social Change Series – Liberation in Three Chapters - 1: 33:49-34:40, 1:34:51-1:35:23]

* There's a moral transformation, transformation of basic political categories which what a revolution really is. But I think in order to go further with this we need to change our basic categories of what labor is. It's just as in the 19th century, the idea of labor theory of value as material production, was incredibly effective, although it turned out to have very real limits which allowed it to be reversed. We need to change our conceptions of labor to one that starts from caring labor. *What society is, is a process of the mutual creation of human beings. So not just the creation of material world, it's a creation of each other.* That's what we're doing. That's what we're doing right now here. Caring, education are the primary things. There is a free education movement right now in Amsterdam and London, there is a huge student movement emerging. I find this very exciting. One of the first things that they're putting in their plank is that *"We've been told that the purpose of education is to improve economy. We want it backwards. The purpose of the economy is to improve education. To give the people the freedom and leisure to understand the world. To learn things."* Our perspectives are totally backwards. *If you take education as part of that broader process of caring, mutual nurture and mutual support that creates the world by which we create each other.* I think that if we begin to look at the world that way, well of course that's the way the most people who ever lived get see the world. Most societies it's just assumed that material production is just one subordinate moment in a broader process by which we create each other - creating people. *Thus factory labor is a form of carying labor if the stuff you're producing in a factory is that people care about, is that people need. But it's sort of second order form. It's things that are useful in what's the really primary business of human life which is our taking care of each other. And I think that if we transform our categories, begin to rethink the world in that and make that common sense, then we'll truly have achieved a revolution.* link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QUdrdgPI-I&feature=youtu.be&t=1837[(David Graeber: All Economies are Ultimately Human Economies (2015): 30:37-33:23)]

* So, I suggested that instead of production and consumption we substitute care and freedom. Perhaps caregiving and care is really that work we do which maintains and increases other people's freedom of which the paradigm would be *play*. Because play is action done for itself. Because what is caregiving labor?

* How to speak giraffe with our inner jackals? And in fact, they are probably the most severe jackals we will ever have to deal with. First of all they are so much faster than these other jackals. These inner jackals, they speek with a speed of light, and they have been in there for so long, that often time we are not even aware, that we are jackaling ourselves. Therefore giraffes love to have certain feelings. Giraffes love to have feelings like depression and guilt. Why does the giraffe like those feelings? Because those feelings tell us, jackals infested our thinking. That we are jackaling ourselves. We're telling ourselves that there's something wrong with us. And whenever we're doing that, as a giraffe, we want to tame those inner jackals. How do we tame an internal jackal? The same way we tame an external jackal. *No matter what message comes at you from another person, no matter how jackalish it sounds, it's simply an expression of feelings and unmet needs.* So we put giraffe ears on and we hear the feelings and the unmet needs. We do the same thing with our internal jackals. *Once we've had identified that we see what we're telling ourself, we want to translate that internal judgement into "What are the feelings and needs that are being expressed through this self judgement?" And then you know what we find?* The same thing we find with external jackals. *That there are no jackals. Jackals are simply giraffes with a language problem. [All jackals are just illiterate girrafes.] Likewise these internal messages, that keep eating out our soul and morale, if you really hear the life energy being expressed behind that message, we find out that it's a very loving message.* We don't feel bad about ourselves at all. ... Whey you have the word "fault" in your consciousness, you know, you have been beset with jackals. When we think in a jackal way, there always must be fault, blame. [But isn't this how the news are presented in media? Every day? Justice based on retribution? *Retributive Justice?* "They did something what we label as WRONG, they do what they SHOULDN'T, therefore they DESERVE punishment!"] ... "I'm sad, I really would have liked to have known then what I'm learning today." Now you're in touch with life energy behind your message. You're really hearing what you feel and need. But notice how different it is from thinking that thinking "there is something *wrong* with you. That you *should* have known better." *Notice that when we are in touch with our feelings and needs, that motivates us to do something about the needs. But when all it goes in our head is "should have" and "what's wrong with you" [or what would the others think about me], that doesn't help us learn from the situation. That doesn't mobilize us to change.* [link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwEC4yvrb0&feature=youtu.be&t=1209[All we can do is to hate ourselves.] We just keep beating ourselves up for years, until we tame those inner jackals which always means to get connected to the life energy behind it. link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLgGt7yLhJg&feature=youtu.be&t=6084[Atelier communication non violente - Marshall Rosenberg - Danemark - sous-titres français: 1:41:25-1:46:16]

    . Abstain at all times from any ecologically unsafe [or toxic] influence strategies [a.k.a. power over tactics [Marry Parker Follett]]:
      **** fear induction: threat/fear of punishment, fear of not getting a reward, fear of making mistakes
        ***** *If I want to resolve conflicts with other people, they must know, that it is abhorrent to me, totally against my religion ever to use punishment to get what I want.*
      **** guilt induction
        ***** "I feel because you ..."
        ***** Guilt: the belief, that someone is a cause for the other person's feelings. It's never the other person that causes suffering for other people [unless it's a physical or material damage]. You can never psychologically hurt the other person even if you try. It's their unmet needs that hurt them.
        ***** No more blaming of other people for one's suffering, in the process of trying to influence through enough guilt, that the other person will give in.
      **** shame induction
        ***** verbal and cognitive - through thoughts
        ***** Abstain at all times from any words which categorizes behavior. To let the other person know that I have no words in my consciousness for evaluating whether your position is right, wrong, good, bad, normal, abnormal, appropriate, inapropriate, [responsible, irresponsible].
        ***** Claiming what's wrong with them, to get them to change, because I convince them how terrible they are.
      **** These are ecologically unsound strategies because even if you get what you want from the other person using any of those strategies, you create an environment for yourself that is highly toxic. *Punishment is a highly toxic form of influencing human being. Even if you get what you want you pay dearly for it. You poison the environment because you communicate that you are a predator prepared to make people suffer if they don't give you what you want.*

  *** Jackals think of these two possibilities: I must have all the power to force other people to behave, or the other option they think of is permissivness, giving up power and just giving in, letting the children [or the other people] over. How do we express our value judgements in giraffe? *"I would like, if you're willing. But, please, don't do it unless you're willing 'cause we both lose."* How do we recognize that the other person heard a request and not a demand? How do we get across now that it is in fact "I would like, if you're willing". When the person now *trust* that we're not saying the old messages. First of all, they may be suspicious for a while. Then you get responses like "Yes, mein Führer!" They believe, this is just a jackal trying to sneak into a giraffe's clothing. Even though I'm now practicing another language. They don't know yet that I'm really graduated. [They might say:] "Don't pull any of that giraffe business on me!" There is still worry that it's still your objective to get what you want. And as long as that's your objective, you can't get it. *So, as a giraffe, it's never your objective to get what you want from other people. It's only your objective to get what both people want. It's only when the other person trusts that I value their needs equal to my own [that their needs are equally as important as mine, that their needs matter equally as mine], that I have any _power with_ that person.* This is the central difference between power over - jackal power, and power with - giraffe power. Power over, jackal power, is easy to get: all you got to do is to make the other person suffer if they don't do what you want. But giraffe power, power with, I only have that to the degree to which the other person *trusts* that I am equally interested in their need fulfillment as my own. When they trust that I know that I can't benefit at their expense [because benefitting at somebody else's expense is not a benefit at all, because it's not sustainable, and it crumbles sooner or later anyway], and I have no desire to. It's only when they trust, I believe firmly enough, for what I'm asking for, I don't have to use fear, guilt or shame inducing tactics [or any other power over tactics]. When they trust all of that, then they can hear that that's just my request. This might be new on my part, so they might not trust it yet. +
  Different ways that jackals express no: "Yea, yea, yea, later", "Yes, mein Führer", "Who was your slave in your prior incarnation", or (sigh). All of these reaction tell us that this person is burdened, they're having to protect the most precious that each of us has: our autonomy. That is so difficult when that's under pressure. We'll fight to the death if we will have any source of humaneness left in us. None of us want's to do things because we're forced to do it. That's what I mean by "loving the life in the 'no'", be happy that this person is not doing it. Because when people do it and they don't look inside to see they're doing it inspite of themselves, everybody pays. That's why in giraffe we really mean it: *"Please do this ONLY IF you are willing. We all suffer unless everybody is doing things simply because they want to, because they see how it contributes to life."* +
  *I'm not saying what you should say. If I'd tell you what you should say, my guess is you'll have trouble accepting it. "I'm offering you something that I'd say..."* ... *I wouldn't say "Only do this if you want to" 'cause I'm still telling them what to do. I'm still thinking that I'm the person who's job it is to tell them, what to do.* That wouldn't meet my need, just if they did, if they want to. *The other thing about that is, as a giraffe, I know that people never do anything except what they want.* So that's kind of superflous. I don't think anybody ever does anything except what they want. The only difference is, jackals lie about it. They say "I didn't wanna do it." Then why did you do it? "They made me do it." "I had to do it." "Superiors orders." "Company policy." [Amtssprache - a language that denies choice and responsibility.] There's no responsibility for actions in Jackalland. But a giraffe speaking person knows that in each moment each of us only does only what we want. In this sense, giraffes is not introducing anything new into the universe. *People as long as they've ever been around don't do anything except what they want.* +
  "What if we requested the other person to do something?" Well, even before the conversation starts, *if my objective is to get the other person to do what I want I've lost already.* *"What would the giraffe objective be?" To make a connection with that person. Giraffe dance. Giraffes like to dance. And there is a certain kind of dance that goes: Empathy, Honesty, Empathy, Honesty, ... And giraffes really like that dance 'cause they believe miracles can come off that dance. When we really connect with people in a certain way, any kind of conflict can be resolved* without fear, without guilt, without shame [or any other power over tactics]. *So we trust that dance.* If we go in wanting to dance, well, and we trust that we may come out with the person doing what we want, for reasons what we want. There is no force on it, they're doing it willingly 'cause they see the purpose [meaning, reason]. Or we come out of it valuing what the other person dit, or wants to do. Maybe, so *we don't know, that as a giraffe, we know that if we dance, we'll like whereever we end up. I'm trying to form a kind of connection with this person, that I think is conducive to working out whatever differences are there. I want to form a quality of connection, that's my primary objective*, quality of the connection, and then I trust, that if that quality is of a certain sort, where all of our energy doesn't go into defending each other, violating each other. *When we're really safe, and we really trust that each has the other person's well being at mind, then I know, that this is gonna get results.* I have no doubt about it. But I won't go in there, thinking that that's got to be, that they're gonna study.  ... *So I don't know how it's gonna come out, but but I know that if we get there in a certain process, we'll both like it [breathing in the not knowing]. It has to be clear about our values [needs, purposes, reasons]: "What quality of connection do I value making with people?" "Do I value people as an equals?" "If so, then does my behaviour demonstrate that when I'm with other people?"* That doesn't mean that I have equal knowledge, or equal strength, but do I really value treating people as equals. "And how do I do that, if this person is age 5, or 12?" *"Do I value the use of violence for people to get their way?" So it's for me just being consistent with my values and "How I would like people to treat me?" If that's really what I value, that quality of our connection, and trust that it is of a certain sort, then I trust wherever the conflict goes.*

  *** Culturally and politically some people might not be used to this reflection [of feelings and needs] back. [The may consider it as an "invasion" into their private space]. [So, after the empathy,] they may say "Don't pull any of that psychology crap on me!" **So we [show empathy] it again. Silently. For this to be powerful doesn't mean we have to say it outloud.* It's at the very moment that I turn my atention what is this person feeling. So when he says "Don't pull any of that psychology crap on me!" I turn my attention to what is the other person feeling [and what of their needs are not being fulfilled] when he/she says that. I guess the other person is scared and annoyed [nervous, uncomfortable, unpleasant], 'cause he/she may not understand what this [my response] is all about, and the other person wanted me to respond in a way that he/she was more familiar with. That's what I hear in that message. I don't have to say it outloud. *I'd like to be able to say it outlout to check it out 'cause I might be wrong, but just the fact that I'm trying to find the person's feelings [and unfulfilled needs with possible request for me] is already a success. Because when I'm looking for another person's feelings, I take away all power that person has to limit my power, my personal sense of respect.* Only when I take in the judgement, it starts to get scary.
  *But when I'm conscious that* +
   +
  *all judgements [analyses, diagnoses, enemy images, blames]* +
  *are simply tragic, [suicidal, alienated] expressions of needs* +

  *** *Better to have [the Nonviolent Communication] in your heart and be broken for the words. "Whenever I really get connected to that energy, even when I speak jackal it's giraffe." So the words aren't as important as the consciousness of why I'm interrested in giraffe. The quality of the connection. If that's really what you're after, the words come with practice. But it's that spiritual quality at the beginning. Without that [spiritual quality] the rest doesn't help.*

* [Compulsory] *Homework* [at and below the highschool level] is unnecessary. Research shows no benefit of homework before high school. And even there it's questionable. So why do we persist? BGUTI! - "Better get used to it!". "People will do to you mean and unpleasant things in the future, start doing them now!" +
Homework is literally all pain and no gain. It produces frustration, exhaustion, family conflicts and nagging, less time for kids to do what they care about when they get home, and loss of interest in learning. Homework effectively extinguishes curiosity [when the kid doesn't do it and the teacher or parent punishes the kid physically or psychologically with shame, guilt, the concept of duty, obligation or deserve]. There is no sacrifice in not giving homework academically. +
"As I got better in teaching, I assigned less and less homework. Now I assign none." *Getting rid of homework was intellectually beneficial.* "Students talked during the lesson about things they learned at the subject and compared them with current events in the world." Homework [can be considered as] a tool for the school how to manage family time. *The family needs to have the freedom to decide how to spend its time!* Instead of making the students work a second shift of academeics at home. +
Six hour of academics is more than enough.

* Talk to your kids at home about *what* they're learning in school. Never about *how well* the teacher thinks they're learning! link:https://soundcloud.com/user-350469784/interviu-alfie-kohn-14-may-2016[Alfie Kohn - Interviu: 9:58-10:17]

* If you need to give grades [or evaluate / judge]:
    . write acomment or talk with the student *without* the grades and points. The students will be more interested in learning *only* when there is no letter or number attached to the comment.
    . let the student decide the final amount of points and the final grade or letter. *The good you've done by removing grades from the occasion [and consciousness] and the trust you've shown to the students _far_ outweights the situations in which some students use the system for their advantage.* +

[Nonviolent communication] is faster [to learn] when people have the purpose of it in mind. ... *The purpose is not to get people to do what you want, but to create the quality of connection that everybody's needs get met [compassionately].* That is a radicaly different story that most of us have been taught. *We have been taught, there is a right and a wrong way to do everything. The authorities know what's right. If you want to make it in this world, you have to do what the authorities say is right.* link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqJ-0EIsy9U[(Marshall Rosenberg - NVC Workshop 2004 Portland, OR: 1:59:39-2:00:38)]

* *It's very dangerous to mix up the words natural and habitual. We have been trained to be quite habitual at communicating in ways that are quite unnatural.* link:https://darjeelingzen.blogspot.com/2012/03/gandhi-select-quotations.html[Mahatma Gandhi]

* ... I think Giraffe is a natural way for human beings to communicate. Now when I was learning giraffe, I kept saying to myself "This isn't the natural way for people to talk!" And just at the right moment I read something that Gandhi said. Gandhi said "Don't mix up that which is habitual with that which is natural." That made sense to me. Certainly it wasn't habitual for me to speak Giraffe. But Gandhi says that *what is natural is that what you gravitate to spiritually. It feels right to you, and you're willing to do a lot of practice, a lot of work because you see the work is in the harmony with your own values.* I really do believe that Giraffe is much closer to spiritual basis of people, and they feel that talking this way makes more sense intuitivelly. To talk just about what they feel, what they need, inspite of the fact that they may have to do a lot of practice, inspite of the fact that *for a while until we learn how to use these ears, it can be kind of scary because it requires to being open and honest in a pretty vulnerable way. And we do know that until the other people do join us, we're likely to hear a lot of things coming back, but we're gonna need these ears on.* +

* The behavior of somebody else is never the cause of our feelings. The behavior of somebody else is only the *stimulus* for our feelings [when the damage is psychological; when it goes about physical damage on somebody or something, then the person really *_caused_* the damage]. The cause of our feelings is our *thoughts* stimulated by the behavior and our *unmet needs* behind our thoughts. ... If we're trying to convince ourselves or somebody else that their behavior is the cause for our feelings, then we're are trying to use *guilt* and *shame* to change the behavior of the other person. Guilt means that the other person is responsible for our feelings. This is not possible because we cannot be responsible for something else outside of ourselves. We are only responsible for our intentions, thoughts, words and actions. The other person is not responsible for my feelings, but it's responsible for his or her intentions, thoughts, words and actions. I'm responsible for how I respond to the response of the other person, and for what ear do I have on, giraffe or jackal, when I'm reacting to their response. Shame on the other hand means that the other person is _bad_ for what they're doing and _deserving_ punishment. By Dr. James Gilligan, shame and ebarassement without nonviolent stimulation is the most reliable predictor of future violence and recidivism. Shame increases violence. Punishment increases shame. Therefore, punishment causes higher rates of violence and recidivism. link:...[(M.B. Rosenberg, James Gilligan, Miki Kashtan)]

* The map is not the territory. The words are never what they express. Look behind the words. See the truth. The truth is the other person has feelings and needs that are not being met.

    *** ... *because our most ugly, aggravating jackal is our best guru. We stand more to benefit, more to learn from those people who's beauty we cannot see, that anybody else. They're our best teachers.*
  ** 7:43-12:16 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdFc2B-tZLc&feature=youtu.be&t=462
    *** *I just want you to be conscious that this person isn't making you angry. It's that _thought_ [the enemy image, moralistic judgment] that's making you angry.* That they're *cutting you off from your father*. Because I will bet you that that is associated in your thinking with the *violent S H word*. I hate to say it outloud. *Should*, that they *shouldn't cut you off from your father.* Do you believe that that they shouldn't do that to you? "Absolutely." *It's the S H word that makes us angry. If we didn't have the S H word in our consciousness we wouldn't have so much violence.* That's why I don't like to say it outloud. *The S H [the 'should'] word creates great violence on our planet.* +
    In a sense it's a handy abbreviation 'cause the S H word basically means "The other person is bad and deserving a punishment". It's all contained in that S H word. +
     +
    *Should = "This person is bad" + "This person is deserving a punishment."* +
     +
    *It's an abbreviation since we use it so much, we have so much violence that we wanna blame and [do other life and relationship damaging things] ... But you don't have to say it. It's implicit.*
    *** *Never hear what a jackal thinks. Especially never hear the 'should' word. Don't hear it! Don't go there! Life isn't fun when we join the other person in their thinking. Go to their heart! There is no 'should' in their heart.* ... Especially someone in an authority. I hope everybody in here had their children already convinced of that. To tell your children *"Never hear what I say you should do."*
    *** [11:57] [If you use] any one of those words, the problem is, you pay for those words. ... Read about Type A thinking and the effect it has on heart disease [This research had been already criticised because multiple variables play a role in heart disease prevention. But it also may contribute to getting a heart disease]. Because [these feelings and words] are not only destructive to our spirit. It's also very destructive to our bodies. These are not natural feelings. +
    *In Daniel Goleman's book Emotional Intelligence, when a need isn't getting met it gives off energy* which we call *feelings*. *The feelings tells us the need isn't getting met, they mobilize us to action, to get something done. So this wonderful energy gets channeled into need serving action.* ... *[With] any living fenomenon this happens. The need when it's not being met [and also when it does get met] emits energy source which is the feeling...* [The intensity of the feeling depends on to what extent the need was being met.] +
    *but we human beings, we had this trick played on us ...: The need isn't getting met, but we don't have a _need consciousness_.* [does it somehow relates to _class consciousness_? I wonder...] *We've been educated not to be in touch with our needs. So we go to _enemy images_. "He should ...!", "He's irresponsible!", "That's selfish!", "Shurking duties!" We have our head filled with thousands of [enemy images]. And when our head is filled this way, we're gonna feel one of [these unnatural] feelings:* +
    **** *depression, guilt and shame* if we direct the judgement to ourself. "I was irresponsible." guilt, shame. "I'm a failure." depression 
    **** ... if we direct it outward: *anger* +
     +
    *But notice what's happened. We're cut off from life. We're not really alive, we're not in touch with life.* +
    And then *what kind of energy will this give us?* *Punitive action*, not need serving action. *We want to blame and punish this rascal.* Yea, *there is a need down there that isn't getting met, but we've lost connection with that. We're up in our head judging [analyzing, diagnosing, having an enemy image of] the other person. All we want is is to see that person suffer.* +
     +
    Especially when we have the other dangerous word in our head along with the S H word. *Much of our violence comes from the S H word ['should'], and the D E word ['deserve'].* All you gotta do is to think somebody deserves something and, oh, you're violent. +
    Think that because somebody does something they deserve to be rewarded. +
    Think that because somebody does something they deserve to suffer, they deserve to be punished. +
    A very dangerous word. And put those two together: *"He's doing what he shouldn't! He deserves to..."* +
    *Rewards are violent ... because they are part of 'power over' [game or authority model]. One person trying to use the power that they have _over_ another person.* +
    *[For example] I have some money and you don't have, so I say: "You do this, I'll give you the money." ["Za čo ťa platím!"] You need to eat. "I'm not gonna give you the money unless you do this."* That's a way of using power over people.

    *** Let's set boundaries, it's very important. But not [only] for children. [Set boundaries] for every human being. +
     +
     *Any human being who is violating a need of yours, and is unwilling to negotiate about it, tell them what you're gonna do, and do it. Use protective use of force. But do that with everybody.* +
      +
     Don't think that's just with children. *We all need clarity.* +
     *If a basic need of yours is not getting met in your relationship with me and I'm not willing to talk about it, tell me what you're gonna do to protect yourself and do it! But don't use any punishment [because punishment never works in building a connection, a relationship iwith the other person]. Don't get [boundaries and discipline] mixed up with punishment.* +
     *No, [not just] children need punishment. [Noone needs a punishment. Punishment it's a strategy, not a need.] And not [just] children need boundaries. [Everybody needs boundary for everybody else.]* +
      +
     *All human beings need boundaries.* +
     In a way that I'm describing.
  ** 22:30-25:30 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdFc2B-tZLc&feature=youtu.be&t=1350
    *** *How about grades? The only purpose I see in grades is to maintain a cast system in our society, and to hide it as a meritocracy or democracy [representative democracy, not direct democracy].* ... "I'm choosing not to give grades." ... "Half the students of this university are black, half are white, blacks get 80% of failing grades, I choose not to participate on any evaluation scheme that differentiates on the basis of race or culture [or socioeconomic status]. Also, research shows that *the more grades are given the more students lose perspective on what they're learning.* So *then they learn not for the value of what they're learning, but for the extrinsic rewards*", which of course is the *purpose in the jackal culture*. *You want people to get used to working for extrinsic rewards, things like salaries [points, grades, credits, titles, etc. so they'll be able to pollute the environment and do anything else as long as the boss tells them to do it. And then they get their rewards. So that's what you want to train them for in school.*"
    *** *"We have to have accountability!"* and I said "Now that I share the universitie's desire at that level. *We do need to know, whether people have learned, what ... the course involved.* ... *I will give you at the end of the course an instruction, a measurable assessment, of what students could do at the end that they couldn't do at the beginning.* I this respect I'm far more accountable, than a teacher who gives you a C or D. You don't know what that student could do? You will know what each of my students can do at the end what they couldn't do at the beginning." So because of that, I was being more accountable.
  ** 30:05-33:29 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdFc2B-tZLc&feature=youtu.be&t=1805
    *** I don't think you get angry because your need for respect and appreciation isn't getting met. *For example, if I come along and I say to you "Get out of my way, idiot!" and for whatever reason you think "Maybe his wife died, and he is mourning." I don't think you'd feel angry. [reference to Fundamental Attribution Error; Is it the thinking that is the cause of calmness and understanding?]* Even though your need wasn't getting met for respect or so ..., but I don't think you'd be angry. Because you'd probably tell yourself something different than what you're telling yourself if your angry. So you still haven't answered my question about the cause of your anger. *Just because your need for respect doesn't get met doesn't make you angry. [It's the thinking that makes me angry and provokes violence?]* ... [Feelings] are the first thing what we [may be] aware of, but it's not the first thing that happens. Te first thing that happens is when I'm asking you to get at now that you haven't gotten at yet. And that's whatwhy i'm pushing you to get at it. Because it needs to be gott out into the light [to the consciousness], and that is I think *you need to be clear what is making you angry. It's not that your need is not getting met. What are you telling yourself? [The thinking makes me angry? The thinking is the cause of my feelings? Unpleasant and pleasant?]* +
    *"Some jackal thought". That's the first thing that came. But your inner jackals speak so rapidly, and it's been in there for so long  that you're very often not conscious of them.* +
    *I'm saying all of these [feelings: anger, depression, guilt, shame and maybe rage, hate, jealousy and envy] can be productive if you do the following work:*
    . If you identify the thinking that is making you feel this way.
    . And if you use these feelings as an alarm clock, to tell you that part of your connection to your needs is being blocked by life alienated violence provocative thinking. ... These feelings are valuable if you use them as an alarm clock. And if you use them as an alarm clock and get connected [to your needs], you'll have more energy, not less, but the energy will be directed toward getting your need met, not to blaming or punishing yourself or others.

    *** *... our basic need is to enjoy life. How can we enjoy life if our needs aren't getting met? So, to enjoy life is to get our needs met in a way that doesn't create problems for us later.* Giraffes are cheap. They don't like to pay for getting their needs met.

    *** ... *What would you do when they're putting your people into concentration camps? ... First thing you need to do is transform all enemy images into needs. You're gonna have no power with people until you can translate your enemy images [into needs]. 'Cause as long as you see that you're more likely to generate counterviolence than cooperation.* +
    *... social change [tranformation of gangs: institutions] ... Some gangs call themselves gangs. Some gangs call themselves multinational corporations. Some gangs call themselves governments. ... How do you deal with gangs? Gangs ... are creating great violence.* +
    *The first thing is: _Get rid of any enemy image of the gang members._ As long as you think there is something wrong with the gang members, you'll create more violence, I predict, than cooperation.* +
    *"So we're supposed to like it that they're putting our people in the concentration camps and not feeding them, and ...!"* +
    *I'm not asking you to like it. I'm asking you to do more than that. I'm asking you to be able to see that that's _the most wonderful thing_ in the world that these people could be doing [at the level of needs - not strategy!]. "WHAT!?"* Then I explain. And it has to be sincere. "Explain..." +
    *** When I work with my colleagues in Sierra Leone, we're looking at why would this person take a 6 year old child and heck off the arm. *If you thinks that's evil, or bad, I'm suggesting you'll create more violence [counterviolence]. [So it's the thinking that can connect or disconnect us from our own needs or from the needs of others?]* ... *The first thing is to realize, to be conscious that the person who does that does it for the same reason you and I do everything we do.* ... +
     +
    *Each moment every human being is doing the best they can at that moment to meet their needs.* +
     +
    And whatever need they have, I know also that you and I have that same need. +
     +
    *Needs are universal.* +
     +
    *Until we can start by trying to empathize with "What need is this person trying to meet by doing this?"* Until we can connect with that, as *long as we think there's something wrong with this person, that they're bad, we're gonna approach it in a way that I think we'll have less power and more chance to create counterviolence.* +
    ... *Notice what I just said doesn't mean I have to like that behavior. It means I have to see the humanness of the person who is doing it.*
    *** ... I wouldn't even think of getting them to empathize with why somebody has cut off the arms of one of their children, until they've healed from the pain that that's created for them. So I'm not suggesting that we start with that. But then I'm saying when we really wanna change this, in a way that doesn't create more violence, we need to *get rid of enemy images* and *[emphatize which is to] connect with what this person's needs are that are being met [or the person is trying to get met in a greater or lesser extent] by cutting off childrens arms.*

    *** ... control, [manipulation, power] in our culture get seen as a dirty thin 'cause we're associating it with *domination*. But we all [have a] need to have some control and power in our environment, or this is pretty scary world if we don't have some power. +

    *** How do you keep your humanness in a complicated system where... +
    Walter Wink said something that really helped me. He in his book _The Powers That Be_ points out that *institutions have their own spirituality*. So *how do you connect with human beings when you're working within an institution that has a spirituality that makes violence enjoyable? Or profitable?* ... *That's how you make [violence] enjoyable: to believe that [violence] is necessary and protecting the 'free' world and so forth.* They won't say enjoyable. They'll say necessary, but it's enjoyable. +
    The answer is *you and me need to, *
    . *first of all, know how to create that world that we want to live in ourself, while at the same time creating what Gramsci calls _Prefigurative relationships_, that is relationships that model the larger governmental structures that we would like to see in our families and in our workplaces that we can control,*

    *** One of the things what often people go through when they're learning Nonviolent Communication and *they see how what they're telling themselves creates their feelings*, so they see that they're telling themselves thoughts like *"That was a stupid thing to do."* and it's that the way they took it that's making them feel such shame and guilt. So very often when people see that they're thinking that way that creates their feelings of shame and guilt, then they tell to themselves *"I shouldn't feel that way! What's wrong with me? I've been stduying Nonviolent Communication long enough that I should no longer think that way!"* *They judge themselves for judging themselves which just makes them feel even worse than ever.* We suggest that in learning Nonviolent Communication is very important to keep conscious at all times that +

I was not responding to him with the *respect* that I would like to respond to people. *I wasn't meeting my own need for respecting people.* When I saw that need, I was very sad.

Even though I connected with my needs e.g. for humanity of the pedagogy, honor to the students and understanding of the individual student's needs and empathy to those who are struggling in their studium, I still felt rage, hatered and disgust against those teachers who still treat people like pets by punishing them for things that they shouldn't do, or by throwing them a biscuit or a cookie in a form of reward [bonus point, average value of grades for scholarships instead of needs by income of the student and his or her parents], even though I knew the teachers have a need for more engagement from students, more motivation, quality of knowledge, supporting of those who really want to learn, but at the cost of ignoring the rest, discouraging ["I'm not sure this is the right school for you." Alžbeta Klaudínyová, Algebra] and eliminating them [by points, grades, credits] in order to "Fulfill the numbers" for the amount of eliminated students instead of understanding and supporting them, oppressing [Amtssprache: "You have to use this, otherwise ..."] and frightening them ["Plagiators will be punished."] in order that the students would be easier to manipulate. I still felt rage, hatered and disgust, even though I was connected to my unfulfilled needs, my needs that I tried to fulfill, their unfulfilled needs and their needs that they are trying to meet. But the rage and hatered persisted, even after connecting with those needs, as if something pulled me back away from the sweet pain back to the bitter pain. I felt helpless and frustrated of it. And I think *it was the violence provocative thinking, the enemy images, the moralistic judgements and statements like 'should', 'deserve'* that constantly and consistently were pulling me back to the world of 'right and wrong, good or bad' Rumi talks about. There was so much pain from all the schools and teachers. Too much accumulated trauma that I didn't know how to handle. So I rather quit to release myself from the constant tension I felt every time from meetings, constant evaluation, articles, deadlines, ... +
    So what to do? +
    Maybe *replacing the violence provocative thinking with peace promoting thinking*. +
    Maybe *consciousness that they are trying to meet their needs too and I have the same needs* could help. +
    Maybe *gratitude and thanksgiving* will help. +
    Maybe *gratitude for the things and people that annoy me because at least they are doing something for others*. +
    Maybe *there is some good in everything*. +
    Maybe *enjoyment of the thoughts and beliefs that I tell to myself when I feel depressed, anxious, blamed, ashamed, envious, jealous, angry or enraged and their consequent observation with interest and curiosity and questioning, empathy for them, their possible origin in order to prevent such situations and learn from them*. +
    So connection to needs isn't enough. +
    *Connection to needs together with peace promoting thinking is enough.*] +
     +
    And then I asked myself: *"What need of mine was I trying to meet by behaving in a way that I did?"* And all of the sudden it became very clear to me what my need was. *I needed understanding for how frightening it was for me to hear somebody saying "Above all you have to teach people obedience to authority!"* The word "above all" stimulated in me memory of how in Nazi Germany people were educated to believe *"Above all you have to obey the Führer!"* +
    *Then I saw both parts of myself. I mourned that I didn't meet my need for respect the a way I treated this person.* But I could also see that *I behaved as I did out of my need for understanding for how frightening it was for me for authorities who have this belief that "Above all we have to teach children obedience to authority!"* By being in touch with both of those needs, I had a better chance to learn because I said to myself *"How would I have liked to behave differently in that situation?"* +
    And I realized If I have behaved differently I would have liked to understood what was the person feeling and needing behind this statement *"Above all we have to teach people obedience!"* And I realized, he probably had a *need for order and safety* in the schools and believes that this is important for having rules to maintain this order and safety. And I had the same needs. *So then I could see that we didn't have different needs. We may have different strategies, but we didn't have different needs.* +
    *I saw that if I would have heard that message with empathy* and seen that we have the same needs, I would have responded to him in a much different way. In a way that I believe *we could have learned from each other without becoming enemies.* +
    ... and *then I could show him that I was also in favor of rules, but then I showed him a different way of establishing rules and rules based on [consensus and] the protective use of force, and not the punitive use of force*, and we connected in a very positive way. +
    So I offered this as an example *how we can learn from our limitations without blaming ourselves, hating ourselves*, and *we do that by being conscious of what need isn't met by our behavior*, and *then empathizing with what needs we're trying to meet at those times that we are behaving in a way that doesn't meet some of our needs.*

    *** Another way in which Nonviolent Communication supports the people in living the life they choose to live, instead of the life that sometimes they have been programmed by their culture to live, is to know *how to deal with other people's messages* that come at you *in way that never gives other people the power to dehumanize you.* +
     +
    [More details in session 4 - The Dynamics of Empathy] +
    [... because when we direct our attention here, to what's going on inside the other person, *we take all power away from other people to deplete our morale, to make us feel bad about ourselves.* And what's nice about this is that it's good for the other person as it is for us. Because when we do tune in to what's going on inside of them, we're much more likely to respond with compassion with them. So everybody benefits (reference to Mary Parker Follett and John Nash - win-win solution) at the moment we put on the giraffe ears, even when we don't say a word.)] +
     +
    For the moment I would like to concentrate on *how we can train ourself never to give our power away to other people*. I asked a lot of people *"What are you affraid to say? Give me example of when you're affraid to be honest, affraid to be yourself to say something?"* And when people in the group have thought of what they're affraid to say and write down what the message might sound like, I then asked them *"What makes you affraid to say that?"* And almost everybody answers my question of why they're affraid this way: *"Well, I'm affraid that if I said that, the other person might..."* +
    *And then they tell me what they think the other person might* +
    *say to them* +
    *or* +
    *think of them.* +
    And I point out to people *how concerned I am about that that's what we have to be affraid of: "How other people might respond to us?"* [reference to External locus of control] *That is what they might say about us, or think about us.* +
     +
    And I point out that *by doing that we're giving our power to other people!* +
     +
    *We're thinking that our safety depends on how other people might respond to us.* +
    [That's how I was brought up to think, mainly by my grandmother. She'd say: *"What would other people say?"* or *"What would people think of you?"*] +
     +
    I then try ot show people that *our need is to be concerned with how we respond to how the other person responds. That's where our safety is: in how we learn to respond to other people's judgements or criticism of us. But not to give our power away by thinking that our safety is solely "How they might respond?".* +
     +
    So in other words *our safety is in how we respond to other people! Not how they respond to us.* +
     +
    And I then show them how we have all these choices when people say things to us. +
    How we can take it personally and feel shame. [I take almost everything about me personally. Maybe gratitude can help me to cope with that.] +
    How we can judge them and feel angry. +
    Or how *we can empathically connect with them and then when we do that we can learn from whatever that person is saying in a way that's valuable to us.* So in this way people can see that +
     +
    *our safety is a result of how we respond. That puts our safety in our hands, and doesn't give our power away to other people.* [reference to Internal locus of control] +
     +
    In schools that we've created which we call _Nonviolent Communication Schools_ in areas, and we have other names for them in other areas, but in these schools we teach the teachers and administrators, and students [and their parents] how to speak Nonviolent Communication. +
    My oldest son went to a school like this were the students all learned Nonviolent Communication. And we want the students to know what I was just saying that *your security [your power] rests in your hands. Don't ever give up your security [your power] to structures in which you're in or to other people's messages toward you.* +
    One of my happiest days as a parent occured when my oldest son came back from the public school for the first time. The school he had gone to I had had a chance to train the teachers, but in the public school the teachers communicated in a way which I wouldn't like to see how teachers or administrators would communicate with the students. My son came home the first day, and I asked him: "How is the new school, Rick?" He said: "It's okay, dad. But boy, dad, some of those teachers, wow!" I said: "What happened?" He said: "Dad, I was only half way through the front door of the school, and some man teacher comes running up to me and says: *'My, my! Look at the little girl!'*". The teacher was reacting to my son's hair which was down to his shoulders at the time. This is unfortunately rather typical of many schools. Look at the lessons my son was learning being halfway through the door:
    . *Lesson #1: There is a right and a wrong way to do everything*, such as how to wear your hair.
    . *Lesson #2: Who knows what's right? The people with the highest title.* In this case the teacher knows what's right.
    . *Lesson #3: Try to influence shame and guilt to get people to do as you want*
    . *Lesson #4: It's a shame to be a girl.* +
     +
    All of those lessons very quickly had my son halfway through the door of the school. So I said to my son: *"How did you handle it?"* He said: *"I remebered what you said, dad, that when you're in that kind of structure, _never give the structure or the people in it the power to make you submit or rebel._"* This is one of the things that would I hope we all help our children to learn. +
     +
    *To learn how to come from your own spirituality. "How to answer for yourself whats the way which I choose to live?" And to learn how to sustain that and stay conscious of that regardless of the structures you're in, or regardless of how the people within those structures speak to you.* +
     +
    So I said to my son: *"Wow, am I glad that you could remembered that under those conditions? What did you do then?"* +
    He said: *"I just tried to hear his feelings and needs dad. I just guessed he was irritated and wanted me to cut my hair."* +
     +
    And this is another lesson that we would like the children to learn:+ *"How to see people's humanness no matter how they communicate?"* +
     +
    Once again I was very delighted that my son could remember to do that. And I said to him: "How did you feel after you heard what you thought what he might be feeling and needing?" He said: *"Dad, I felt sad for the man. He was bald and seem to have a thing about hair."* +
    So this is one of the lessons that Nonviolent Communication is designed to help us remember at all times. +
     +
    *No matter what structures we're in, never give the structure or its rules the power to determine what we do. To make sure that each of our actions comes from a consciousness of our own values and our choosing to act in harmony with our own values. In this way we are not submitting or rebelling. We're acting in harmony with our own values each moment.* +
     +
    Walter Wink, the theologian, says *"It's very important to be conscious that institutions have their own spirituality."* +
    *So many structures are set up in a way that are designed to get people to obey authority no matter what the authority wants them to do.* So I would hope that we educate ourselves that *no matter what structures we're in, we stay connected to our own spirituality, and neither submit, nor rebel.*. And then I hope that we all develop the skill that my son had demonstrated by *no matter how people speak to us, whatever their titles, that we try to see their humanness, but not to give them the power, to make us submit or rebel, and not to give them the power to create shame on our part, depression on our part*, but this requires some skills that we'll be talking about in subsequent sessions that will show us *how to see other people's humanness even when they're speaking to us in a violent language, even if they have positions of power within institutions that do not share values of compassion*.

    *** For many of the people who come to our Nonviolent Communication trainings, what I'm suggesting of focusing our attention on the present, on what's alive on the other person, what they're feeling, what they're needing. They tell me, it's a rhythm they're not used to. *They're so used to getting defensive when other people tell them what's wrong with them, or they just fade out when people are using more words that they want to hear.* And they ask for what could they do to speed up their ability to just connect to what's alive in people. And this exercise that I have given people over the years seems to help a lot. It's an exercie I once did when I was first learning empathic connection, and wanting to improve my ability to hear what's alive in people, no matter how they communicate to me. +
    *I made a list of messages that people might say to me that made me affraid to reveal myself.* In other words I said *"What messages have I been affraid to express in my life?"* and *"Why am I affraid to express these things?"* And I realized how much I was telling myself *"Well, if I am honest about this, this other person might say to me: 'The problem with you is that you are too sensitive.' or something like that"*. I could see that *I was telling myself that my safety depended on how other people might respond to me.* +
    *And I was keeping a lot of myself hidden because I was telling myself that I had to be affraid of what people might say to me.* But then I started to realize: +
     +
    *"I don't have to worry about what people say to me. I only have to worry about how I respond to that."*. +
     +
    And I saw that *if I can respond emphatically to a message, I can hear the truth! What that person is really feeling and needing.* I don't have to be affraid to reveal myself. +
     +
    So what I did was this exercise: +
    . I listed some of the things that I was most affraid that people might say to me, if I was honest.
    . And then I practiced emphatizing with those messages. +
    And here is how I did that: +
    For each message on my list, I could see that I was affraid to reveal things about myself for fear of getting that message back. For every one of them I thought *"What might the stimulus be for a person to say that to me?"* that is *"What I might have said or done that might stimulate this message that I was so affraid of getting back?"* And for each item on the list then that I saw that I had been hiding parts of myself out of fear of somebody might say this back to me, *for every one of the messages I practiced sensing, guessing: "What that person might be feeling and needing if they said that to me?"*  +
    So if they said something to me and I didn't like it and they said back to me: "The problem with you is that you're too sensitive!" Well, I tried to guess: *"If they said that to me, what would they be feeling or needing at that time?"* And then I wrote on this exercise a sheet that I have developed for myself. I imagined the person saying that to me *"The problem is you're too sensitive."* And *maybe the stimulus was they had said some thing to me, and I instead of giving them empathy I started to justify*. So if they said "The problem is that you're too sensitive." *I guessed, maybe at that moment at that moment the person is feeling frustrated because their need for understanding wasn't met by how I responded.* And this was kind of fun for the first four or five messages just to see that these *things that I've been so affraid of* what people might say, *how different it was if I could just learn to hear the feelings and needs behind any message*. +
    [What if a programming language could speak? How would I empathically connect with a thing like language, or material things, or even abstract things. What if these things that I see as mute, could speak. What if they could speak Nonviolent Communication? And how would I hear their messages empathically?] +
    And to this day *this has been quite a relief for me to be conscious _"I don't have to worry about being honest with people and how they might respond? I only have to be prepared to empathically connect with whatever comes back."_ And that means my power is in my hands. My security is in my hands. [reference to Intrinsic locus of control]* *It's not in what other people think about me or say to me.*

  ** *The map is not the territory. You're not aware of the dangers of the words. Words are never what they say. [Words are descriptions of other persons feelings and needs, whether more accurate or alienated from them, but always about feelings and needs.]*

  It's a blessing to serve. It's a blessing to be asked. +
  I'm blessed by you asking me to do something for you. +
  [Demands are gifts to me. The other person wants to enrich my life. The other person wants somebody to enrich their life. To see demands, Amtssprache, raised voice, accusations as *precious gifts* from the other person, *how the other person wants to enrich my life*, and how *I can enrich the life of the other person*. It's easier to hear jackal language and demands as precious gifts with a consciousness that my needs are precious gifts, when I first translate the message into Giraffe language - into the language of feelings, needs and request, the consciousness that "There is nothing wrong with me. The goal of life is not to be perfect. It's to be progressively less stupid." - but sometimes the cost of mistakes is pretty devastating... I still take such things personally when they're said a jackal way, but when I translate these messages into giraffe,  but the feeling of hurt lasts much less time, because I'm being conscious of my and their fulfilled and needs, I have the consciousness that we all share the same needs and all needs are beautiful, precious gifts, I'm grateful for the opportunity that I can practice nonviolent thinking and proove the robustness of the Nonviolent Communication. +
  I felt such a relief when I realized, that when someone else talks to me with raised voice, tells me what's wrong with me, uses Amtssprache, demand, shame, guilt, duty, fear of punishment, excitement of reward, it's not because the other person wants to harm me. Although I have such experiences over and over in my past. *It's because the other person wants to give me the opportunity how can I make the life of the other person more wonderful, but he or she lacks the language of feelings and needs.* The other person was exposed to other influences, so he or she didn't learn this language. Or simply the other person doesn't want to speak with me with the NVC language. *But anyway, it's still a precious gift for me regardless of the form because I know that behind every message there is feelings and needs.*]
  ** link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfJ_NasCFfQ&feature=youtu.be&t=2305[38:25-39:12] +
  *When I request somebody else to do something for me, I'm giving the other person the blessing to serve me, to give me precious gifts by fulfilling my needs*.
  ** In fact, usually what I've found, since I've been getting my consciousness raised on this, that *almost everytime I hear a demand it's cause the other person is so scared to ask. They don't quite see the beauty of their own needs. They're judging themselves of being dependent, needy, whatever... And they're carrying vestiges from the past that haven't led them to see the beauty of their needs.* So how sad it is for them if I continue that game by hearing it as a demand and responding out of that energy. *So as soon as I hear a demand I need to take a deep breath, and try to empathize with the energy [with the good reasons and external attributions] behind the other person would lead them to express it that way.*
  ** "After all I've done for you the least you can do is ...!" I could say to it *"You're right and it would be my pleasure to give it to you."*
  ** "Everytime that there is a request I must grant it?" +
  Of course, if we have giraffe ears, we know that *a 'No' is just as big of a gift as a 'Yes'. Especially when it's expressed in giraffe*. ... *You say the need behind the 'No'. You're giving the other person [a precious gift*, mem noun, Mitzwah]. *A 'No' is a Mitzwah [a precious gift].* +
   +
  "Would you be willing to spend some time with me at noon because [I would like to have some company with me and not to eat alone]?" and I say "I'm in such pain myself today that what I really need is some space to myself. Would you be willing to search for someone else to spend time with?" +
   +
  *I'm giving you a chance to meet my need...* +
  *[I'm giving the other person an opportunity to make my life more wonderful. My needs a precious gifts for the other person because I'm giving them to feel the pleasure and blessing of giving to me or others (but only for self-full reasons, willingness). So when I think of my needs that way, I have a consciousness that my needs (and requests to meet my needs) are precious gifts and a blessing for the other person, so that he or she can enjoy the pleasure from giving to me or others.]* +
  *Every 'No' [demand, Amtssprache, raised voice] if we hear it accurately it's a [precious gift]. It's telling us what that's person need is.* *If we don't have giraffe ears, we have jackal ears, we hear it as a _rejection_. [And there is no rejection, because everything is a request. We choose to prefer other needs.]* Or we take it as our needs aren't valued, *or our needs are a burden,* especially if the other person says "No! I can't! U have other things! [Can't you see that I've a number of other things to do?!]" +
  *I said the need behind the 'No'* [not just the plain 'No'; I gave the good reasons for doing something else], *and I ended on a request that shows that I was as interested in your need getting met as mine.* *I am confident if we stay with that energy, we can both get our needs met.* Notice I didn't just say "I have a need to take care of myself, period." I didn't just say "I'm gonna take care of my needs." +
  *I wanna search for a way to get everybody's needs met.* +
  *I told you the need that kept me from saying 'Yes',* +
  *but I ended on a request searching for a way to get everybody's needs met.* +
  *So you still feel that your needs matter, even though at the moment I've told you what keeps me from doing what you requested.* +
  *I begin with empathy.* I don't take your need as a burden. I take it as a [precious gift.] *[I continue by] saying what keeps me from saying 'Yes'*. *I end on a clear request searching for [ways] to get [as many needs as possible] met.* +
  You see both from my empathy for your needs and from my continued interest in your needs getting met, you see that it matter equally as my own.
  ** link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfJ_NasCFfQ&feature=youtu.be&t=2587[43:07-45:04] ... *in jackal world ... they define love as denying your own needs. Suppressing them. I'm supposed to be selfless.* ... *But then I'm not giving because [I see the beauty of the other person's needs]. I'm giving out of duty and obligation.* An ugly one *to buy my way into heaven*. We do that not out of caring for the other person. Cause it isn't really taking care of the other person when we're selfless. *We pay for it!* +
  *Any act we take for another person that is not done out of pure joy in serving [not don out of self-fullness],* which means we're not doing it for the other person - we're doing it for SELF-FULL motivations [reasons]. Giraffe requires a consciousness of self-fullness. In jackal land we only know selfish / selfless. [Self-fullness is a new concept.] *... we'll pay for it.* It is taking them away from the divine game we're talking about. *We're bringing them into a game of slavery* that you're forced out of obligation, duty, guilt, fear, shame to do things. To whatever degree we get conditioned to that the person sees serving us out of that energy they condition us in a way that makes it harder and harder for them to give self fully to us. *So we get something now done for us, but the cost is terrible, because it kills, it interrupts this divine energy.*

  ... *I didn't really think that would take care of her needs if she didn't show other people that she's equally concerned in their needs.* +
  The 'Captain' game - what decisions can children make and how well - teaching children responsibility.
  ** link:https://youtu.be/WfJ_NasCFfQ?t=2948[49:08-52:05] +
  *Can you see now how we pay for every decision we make that doesn't come out of concern of other people. [We pay with our relatitonships. The quality of our relationships to us and/or to other people will deteriorate.] Anything we do to force people to give us: We know how we feel about that. We may do it but it's not coming out of the certain energy.* +
  *We pay for every time we give or receive something that is pure, natural giving, or the other person does something for us that isn't out of pure natural giving.* ... *The more I think about that, the more I realize how enormous we pay for any time anything is done for us mixed with this other energy. [We may get sick. Chronically sick.]* +
  To raise my consciousness about the [purity of giving and receiving] I developed this card. I suggested for a while the giving in your closeste relationships is kosher, is pure. Whenever you ask for something, give this card, and the card says: +
   +
   *Please, do as I request ONLY if*+
   you can do so with the joy of a little child feeding a hungry duck. +
   Please, please, please, do NOT do as I request +
   if there is any of the following mixed in even in the tiniest degree: +
   any fear of punishment if you don't, +
   any doing it for reward that I'll like you better if you do, +
   out of any shame, or guilt, or duty or obligation. +
   *Life is too short for us to do anything for each other* +
   *with any taint like that mixed in to the giving.* +
   +
  But of course we're so far from that now because for 5000 years we've been taught *the only way you can motivate sinnful, wretched, creepe human beings is through these power over tactics.* Punishment, reward, shame, guilt, duty. We've been so deeply ingrained with *[from earliest childhood to obey authority without questioning - habitual obedience [notorická poslušnosť] - parents and teachers - to hopefully get a reward when we do what they tell us, or to fear of punishment when we don't - always for our own good - for the good of the child; but now we know that's a lie - it's only convenient for the authorities to teach us these things, not for us]* and so exposed to tactics motivated to get us to do what's good for us and society through those tactics, *that it's pretty hard to get pure giving going between human beings [under circumstances, environment and among people that don't know or doesn't believe in this knowledge].* +
  That's why I like to check myself *to make sure I never do anything for others. Never. Only for self-full reasons. Only when it's _play_. Self-FULL reasons.* +
  *Then they don't have to pay for it* +
  *and for me the gift is _play_.*
  ** link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfJ_NasCFfQ&feature=youtu.be&t=3130[54:42-] +
  *Not for one second do we ever wanna think we do anything wrong. It's impossible. You can't do anything wrrong. Even if you try you couldn't do anything wrong. You didn't meet your own needs.* So *after that* kind of mourning *comes learning without self-hatered*. But *apology*, whatever learning happens, *has the taint of self-hatered associated with it*. [So hatered slows down and blocks the learning?] So we wanna lear, [how we could have] our learning motivated purely by "One learn better how to serve life", not we wanna learn so we weren't such wretched creeps. +
  *Women have been taught: "Once you see the other persons needs, now you have to give up yours." Then you don't see the needs of the other person as a [precious gift]. It's a biiig pressure.* +
  When you need a social structure that requires women to be seen as low priced servants, then you educate them ... to believe that the 'lovingä women is selfless. +
  "How to get out?" You give yourself some empathy. You stop and make sure that *you never agree to what the other person wants unless it's play.* ... *Don't ever do anything if it isn't play.* The empathy might sound like this: +
   +
  Selfless person: I'm really torn right now cause hearing how much this means to you. +
  It's a part of me that really is wanting to jump in and really meet my need to nurture, +
  but there is another part of me that still has this great need right now for <something else>.  +
  So how would you feel about meeting this need [another time] when I would do it out of an energy that meets both of my needs. +
   +
  Oh, I can take that as a gift right now, cause how you empathize with my need. +
  I needed the empathy, but now I can see, I can receive your need as a [precious gift]. +

  *"To give is domination, if I can't also receive."* [Ruth Bebermeier] +
  *If I'm educated to be selfless, I'm not giving other people the opportunity to nurture, to meet their need for giving. I'm the only giver. I'm hoarding the good stuff.* It's tainted because it's not coming out of the real energy. *It's to be a 'good' women. [To buy my way into heaven.]* +
  "How do you interact with such person?" +
   +
  Selfless person: I don't have any needs. That's the difference between you and me. I'm a giver and you are a receiver. I don't have needs. I take care of others. I'm not selfish. +
   +
  Now you gotta say "Bullshit" in Giraffe. +
  I first emphatize: +
   +
  If I'm hearing you, you are pleased with how you've learned to give and do service. +
   +
  Selfless person: That's right. +
   +
  And I feel sad when I don't hear you also expressing your needs because it prevents me to having the joy of giving to you. I would like you to tell me how do you feel when I say this. +
   +
  *That's gonna be hard for them to hear because it goes against years and years and years of training.* +
   +
  Selfless person: I don't feel any more happiness than when I'm eeing my children smiling. +
   +
  It's hard for you to imagine any more joy than giving seeing people's pleasure. +
   +
  Selfless person: Yes. I don't need anything else. +
   +
  You're not looking for anything else in the world. +
   +
  Selfless person: Yea. +
   +
  But I love you so much I wanna show you something equally delicious. Will you give me a chance. +
   +
  Selfless person: I don't hink it will work with me. +
   +
  I'm pretty sceptical whether you can get any happier. You are very happy just giving and seeing your family happy. +
   +
  Selfless person: Yea. +
   +
  All I'm asking is for a chance to show you something that may be equally as much fun, and will also give the rest of us the joy of giving to you, to feeling the same joy you're feeling. +
   +
  Selfless person: Okay... +
   +
  And also mother, when I see the energy behind you when you feed father's pigs, I'm not sure that you really are always giving out of joy. I see sometimes that the giving is done out of obligation. So I really wanna be sure, mom, that you don't ever give to me or anybody if it's not out of pure joy. And how do you feel hen I say that, mum? +
   +
  Selfless person: I'm doing everything I can do. I'm not able to do any more. +
   +
  Yes. That's where my worry is, mother. +
   +
  Selfless person: I would like to correct Marshall. I'm very frustrated when I'm [cooking] five different kind of foods on Sunday lunch because everybody has different [preferences]. ... Everybody has it's own food. +
   +
  So, mum? You know what I would love? It would give me such joy in life, it would really make a smile on my face, if you said "I want you all to cook lunch for me today." So, mum, how do you feel when I say that? +
   +
  Selfless person: Who would cook except of me? +
   +
  I want you to hear mum that that would give so much pleasure. And this is really gonna freak you out, mum. I bet you, it would even give dad pleasure, if we could teach him the joy of serving you. +
   +
  Selfless person: What? +
   +
  I know it seems pretty far stretched, mu, but I really wanna talk with you about this cause I really would like you to learn to receive joyfully as well as to give joyfully. +
   +
  Selfless person: Why are you forcing me. I'm really doing what I can do. +
   +
  It's very painful when you're hearing what I'm saying as a demand. ... I'm sad if what I'm saying is sounding like a demand. Rather I would hope I could express it in a different language so you would see it as a fun possibility, ot a demand. +
   +
  Selfless person: Hm... +
   +
  Hard to imagine to receive it that way. +
   +
  Selfless person: Yea. +
   +
  I'd really like to try again, and at any time, mother, you hear criticism or a demand would you stop me, cause that is not what I'm trying to communicate. +
   +
  Selfless person: Okay... Why don't you accept me the way I am? Why do you alsays to change me? +
   +
  Thank you, mother, that's a big gift that I hear right now. So you really want to be sure that you're accepted for how you are? +
   +
  Selfless person: Yea +
   +
  And that you don't have to do something now to be loved or accepted. +
   +
  Selfless person: I'm doing everything I can. +
   +
  I'm really glad we're making this clear because I have deep love for so much of what you do, and what you are, and what you're giving me in life. That's there. It can never change. It's out of that that I want you to have more fun? I have a need to have more fun? I don't want my need to be a further demand for you, just my need to enjoy the life more and play more. +
   +
  Selfless person: For me it's enough fun when I'm seeing you and grandsons smiling, and I don't need anything anymore. +
   +
  Yea, I hear that you're not making any demands. But I want you to get drunk with bliss. +
   +
  I know that you dont care for dad's drinking. But I want you to drink something that will give you more bliss with less hangover. +
   +
  Selfless person: I'm not so hopeful... + 
   +
  You're not optimistic about that. I'll tell you if you teach me enough Hungarian I'll get this across to you. +
   +
  *[The other person] can't shut off the conversation [even by going away and saying "I don't wanna talk anymore!"]. That's an important message for me to hear with Giraffe ears. I need to see a [precious gift] in that.* ... *I need to do *a lot of empathy as the other person keeps misreading what I'm saying. So that's why I kept trying out new languages. Whatever its gonna take to break through and make this radically different thing seen by the other person.* +
  They can't shut off the conversation. They say "Bug off, creep!" That's an important gift. Where do you go from there? To the same place I always go. They just slammed the door, so I go to here [to the heart]. [*Even when they're gone, I'm talking to them. Because that's gonna affect the energy that exists between us. Whenever I see them again, what goes on in me when they slammed the door is gonna be the energy with which I approach our next conversation.*] "So , I'm guessing that you're really hurt. I hear how painful it is. I'm guessing mum was not getting her need for acceptance met. She's hearing that all that she's given was not been appreciated, and that's very painful, and she really has a need at the mooment to protect herself from any more pain, it's so painful for her, that after all she's given, to interpret it as if she's not cared for."  I hear that. It's a gift. *I hear the gift and I hear what the request is. "What would she like from me right now that gives me a [precious gift] to nurture her in that?* Does she need the space right now?" I will give her the space. I don't think I've done something wrong. *I just hear that she needs the space, or I might want to scream in Giraffe. My needs might be so painful that I want her to give to me!* So I follow her and scream at her in Giraffe. +
   +
  What would you do and say when somebody else tells you "We don't want to have anything to do with you! Don't call, don't write!"? That's a wonderful message to learn from.

  Giraffe: Jackal, when you look at other people, but talk to me at that time, but don't look at me, I feel very hurt [uncomfortable, confused] cause I really need somebody to be directly talking with me. Would you be willing in the future to talk directly to me, look at me and tell me straight to me, what's going on between you and me. +
   +
  Jackal [with Giraffe ears]: I very touched how openly you communicated with me. And I really admire how specific and clear you were. Of course I would be willing to do exactly as you request. +
   +
  Jackal [real life]: What good is talking directly to you do? You never listen. +
   +
  *We wanna be able to speak Giraffe, no matter how the other person speaks.* ... *If you have these ears [Giraffe ears - Giraffe consciousness - Consciousness of observations, feelings needs and request] on, all you hear is the feelings.* +
   +
  *You here no criticism, no judgements, no attack. You simply hear what the other person is feeling and needing.* +
   +
  We don't have to be right as a giraffe. We just have to be looking at what's going on inside this person. What might he or she be feeling if they made that statement "What good is tas talking to you do? You never listen." ... +
  *Never hear what a jackal thinks.* It's ugly up there. *I think you'll like people much better if we tune in to their hearts* not to their heads. Especially if they're a Jackal speaking person. All you can see coming out of there is a bunch of judgements. With [giraffe] ears we tune in to the heart [feelings and needs]. Maybe frustration. *We don't know for sure [what the other person is feeling or needing]. We may check it out.* We have to watch out for the [non-feeling words] because they [show] more what the jackal thinks. *When we are Giraffe speaking people we only use words for feelings words that clearly capture our emotion.* An they aren't really words to descibing what others are *doing to* us. ... *"I feel ignored."* Aren't there times when you think somebody is ignoring you, don't you feel *relieved*? At other times, when you think somebody is ignoring you, don't you feel *hurt*? *You see how words like that really don't capture what's going on inside.* If we speak a word like "I feel neglected" somebody with these ears is gonna hear that much more likely as an attack. A criticism of what they're doing. So frustration yes, but not neglected [or ignored]. ... Sad. That's a feeling. Any guess of a feeling is Giraffe. And, again, to repeat, we don't have to be right, because we can always check it out with the person. We can always say "Jackal, are you feeling sad?" and they say "No, I'm hurt!" or "I'm mad!" *The idea of putting on the giraffe ears is to tune in to the other persons feelings. In fact it isn't even necessary to say it out loud. The miracle occurs at the moment we put on the giraffe ears. Even when we don't say a word.* Because when we direct our attention here [to the heart] to what's going on inside the other person *we take all power away from other people to deplete our morale. To make us feel bad about ourselves.* And what's nice about this is, *it is good for the other person as it is for us!* Because *when we do tune in to what's inside of them, we're much more likely to respond with compassion to them.* So *everybody benefits at the moment we put on the giraffe ears even when we don't say a word*.
  ** link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLgGt7yLhJg&feature=youtu.be&t=2209[36:49-41:44] +
  The second thing that we do is to guess what the person is needing behind frustration. In English this can be done in several ways. We can say "Are you feeling frustrated *because you would have liked...*" Or we can say "Are you frustrated *because you're needing...*"  or *"because you're wanting"* The language doesn't make so much importance here, as that we look for *what is the need that isn't being fulfilled [and maybe indirectly expressed] when this person says "What good is talking to you do! You never listen!"* ... What do you think tat person is needing? Somebody to listen. Let's check it out. Let's see how a Giraffe would put these two things together. +
   +
  Jackal: What good is talking to you do! You never listen! +
  Giraffe: Jackal, are you feeling frustrated because you would like [people] to listen differently and better when you do talk. +
  Jackal: Oh, you couldn't even if you try. You're so narcissistically involved in yourself. You think only you know everything that's worth knowing. *And I'm not the only one who thinks that!* +
   +
  *Now aren't you glad that you have giraffe ears [Giraffe Ears™] because without giraffe ears you could take that personally or you could start to think there is something wrong with this jackal for thinking that way. And at that moment you would be thinking in either of those ways the chances both you and the other person are gonna get your needs met is not very good in my experience. But with giraffe ears we hear no criticism in what the jackal just said. We know that that's the more something sound as an attack, the more the other person is in, and that's just an unmet need. It's a gift. [A precious gift.] It's to give us an opportunity to enrich this person's life! An opportunity because we hear it as a request! We don't hear it as a demand. Because as giraffes we can hear other people's needs, but we don't lose our own power.* +
   +
  *We don't necessarily give up our needs to fulfil the other person's needs. As a giraffe we are conscious what people need most of all is contact. That they feel that they needs matter. And that doesn't mean that we have to do what they're asking, but that we accurately receive what they're needing.* So how could the giraffe respond to that complicated message. +
   +
  Jackal: You couldn't listen even if you try! You think only you have anything worth saying. Well, there is other people that have some intelligence around here beside you! +
  Giraffe: Jackal, it sounds that you're really annoyed and you'd like me to acknowledge that other people have something of worth to offer. +
  Jackal: Oh, but you couldn't. Cause you're really a very sick person, you know that?
  Giraffe: So you feel kind of hopeless whether this could happen and you would like me to change, but your not sure that I can? +
   +
  Notice this poor jackal. It's kind of dazzled. +
   +
  Jackal: Don't pull any of that psychology crap on me! +
   +
  *Why wouldn't a jackal think that? Because with these kind of ears, you feel that's somebody is really trying to understand you, and this isn't a way most people have responded to you when you judging them like that. Of course the jackal might start to feel som suspicion and wonder, whether this is a new way of exploiting and manipulating people. What amazes me is how rarely this response comes back, and thats because even if the jackal is a little suspocious, it feels so good to be heard. To have somebody genuinely interested in hearing what you feelings and needs are behind your statement.* But *even when this message does come out "Don't use any of that psychology crap of me." No problem if we had giraffe ears. We hear the feelings and needs behind that sentence. We may do it silently cause we know if we say it outloud, the person may misinterpret us. But there, what do we hear? We hear the person might be feeling suspicious [scared, annoyed]? And what is the need? He wants to avoid to be exploited in some way he's not familiar with. [He wants to be responded in a way that he's more familiar with.]* +
   +
  *We just hear the human being behind that message, as behind every message.*

  How to use money in giraffe way: +
  [Don't hate money, don't love money. Money itself is cold, detached, indifferent. Money itself is a tool. *A tool isn’t good or bad on its own.* Think of a knife [or a programming language]. It’s amoral. I can use it for good—to cook a meal for my family. Or I could use it violently, to harm an innocent person. In either case, the knife isn’t right or wrong. The person wielding it is the one we pass judgment on. link:http://www.pretendtobepoor.com/why-do-you-hate-money/[]]
  . Never pay money for anything. (Bezahle niemals Geld für etwas.) *Give money. Give it to serve life the way you want to serve. Give money to help people do what they wanna do. If what they do enriches my life, I'd like to give them money to keep giving this to others. (Gib Geld. Gib Geld um das Leben zu dienen, auf einer Weise, auf der du dienen willst.)* +
  . Never charge money for anything. (Verlange niemals Geld für etwas.) *Request money. Request money from people to help you do the work you want to do. (Bitte um Geld. Bitte um Geld von Menschen, damit sie dir helfen, deine Arbeit zu tun, die du machen willst.)*
  . *Transform the concept of worth. (Wandle das Konzept des Wertes um.)* Get that out of your head that anything is worth a certain amount of money. +
   +
  Let's get rid of the word 'pay'. We don't wanna ever pay money. Don't ever pay money for anything. +
   +
  Don't ever say "I'll only give you what I do that's valuable if you give me money." *"I'll be glad to give you what I offer. And I would like you to give me some money, so I keep giving it to others."* +
   +
  *Do you wanna live in a world when people who might have something to help somebody's family only gives it when you give them money? Do you wanna live in that world where money is used that way?* +
  Therefore +
  *Never charge money. Don't do anything for money! Never do anything for money!* +
  Instead +
  *Get money to do what you wanna do. (Bekomme Geld um das zu tun, was du tun willst.)* +
  *Do you see the difference? Do the work that meets your need for meaning! And then get the money you need to do that.* But don't ever do anything for money! Life's too short!

  "I hear the problems you having. I'm really confident these pills will really help your health. I would like to give them to you. And I can give them to you because other people have been benefited by this give me money so I can keep giving this to people. So, I'd like you to tell me, whether you would enjoy giving me some money so I can keep giving this to people. But before you aswer that question, would you tell me what you've just heard?" +
   +
  It may take me three hour before we can get this clear. It's such a radically different concept. +
   +
  " But my experience has been when people really understand this they usually give me 40% more than I was requesting. But more important they enjoyed giving it to me cause they could see that I could only give it to them, cause poeple were giving me enough money to travel to get money for whatever I needed to do my service. So, it's not easy to talk people about this."
  ** *Never do anything for money! Do that what meets your need for meaning and request the money you need to do that.*
  ** When the other person doesn't have the money something we you offered them, most of the time we can think of something what they can do for us to help us and support us in our activities.

  Giraffes know that they never do anything wrong. Giraffes never do anything wrong. Here is how the giraffe thinks about these mistakes: +
   +
  *I sometimes do things I wouldn't have done if I knew then what I since have learned.* +
   +
  So they don't think there's anything wrong with them making mistakes. Giraffes enjoy making mistakes. It's a way to learn. [Mistakes are precious gifts. They show me how to enrich life better.] Unless you blame yourself for it. Wenn you just moarn you see the need that didn't get met by what yo did, it's gonna help you to learn from this. +
   +
  *Wolves try to be perfect. Giraffes try to become progressively less stupid.* +
  If you wanna be perfect every mistake is a catastrophe. Every mistake. So you can avoid mistakes by not trying. You can't fall of the bed when you sleep on the floor. But Giraffes know that life involves progressive learning. +
   +
  *The goal of life is not to be perfect. Anyything worth doing is worth doing poorly.* +
  That's another way of saying the goal is to become progressively less stupid. +
  *The goal of life is not to be perfect. It's to laugh all our laughter and cry all our tears. To celebrate when we get our needs met, and to moarn when we don't. But to moarn without blame. Without thinking that there's something wrong with us.*

  *the privileged are almost guaranteed to win*. Our schools reflect this clearly.
  As I indicated in the previous chapter, the students who get the highest
  grades are not necessarily the ones who have learned the most. They are the
  ones who had already learned what was being presented before it was
  presented because their family’s economic situation provided a head start for
  them in learning the things that are studied in schools. +

*Fundamental Attribution Error*:: ... *we tend to overwhelmingly assume that people's behavior reflects something about them [about their personality]*. In other words we use dispositional attribution [almost] all the time, even when the situational attribution might [have a more significant influence]. ... *we overlook the possibility that people's behaviors are shaped by the circumstances* [situation, environment, people around that person, upbringing, education, religion]. *We'd rather assume that people do what they do because it's reflective of something about them, rather that coming from something more _external_*. ... even if we have both of those explanations available [internal and external] ... Why does this even happen? ... *because situations are invisible*. We see people, we see what they do, but we don't often see the circumstance and situational pressures. ... *when the people are actually influenced by the situations that they're in, we have trouble seeing that influence*. ... This is one fo the topics in social psychology that, I think, has made me a better person. It's one of those things where we know we make these kinds of mistakes and errors when we judge other people, *it can make you more understanding* and open to the fact that *people's behavior is driven by all sorts of things, not just the kind of person they are, but circumstances that they find themselves in*. ... if we can teach ourselves to be open to situational attributions *it might make the world a more understanding place [and that can teach us _empathy_]*. +

The environment matters. The upbringing and education matters. It's not everything in the individual, as almost everything I see tries to convince me of. The enviromental factors and wealth have a decisive impact on the success of the individual.

I can alter my internal environment, my feelings, through *gratitude*. *Gratitude* to practice tolerance, patience, responsibility for my own feelings, empathy, sympathy, enviromental attribution thinking...

It's foolish to believe that happens to individual is caused by that individual +
because we need to acknowledge the influence of the outer environment.

To overemphasize the personal aspects of certain behavior of an individual +
and marginalize the outside influence of the environment +
means to commit a *Fundamental Attribution Error*.

The cause of all of these problems is not only individual. The cause is systemic. The systems shape our reality as well. And the systems are *internalized* by the individual through upbringing and education. The problems are systemic. The systems increase the likelihood to produce these kinds of people. And when and individual doesn't behave as we would like, we blame exactly that individual, not the systems that contributed to the individual's suffering! *Because maybe the individual internalized the systems?* *Maybe these systems are disfunctional and ill and when we internalize them, we individually become ill. Mentally ill. It's a natural and logical consequence of internalizing toxic environment.* We're not fixing the systems to prevent these tragedies. We're fixing the individuals to make them conform to whatever they're told to do by the "authorities".

Merit = IQ + effort +
... well, not quite. What about the situational factors?

link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy#Critique[*Meritocracy*]

* The reliability of the authority and system that assesses each individual's merit is another point of concern. As a meritocratic system relies on a standard of merit to measure and compare people against, the system by which this is done has to be reliable to ensure that their assessed merit accurately reflects their potential capabilities. Standardized testing, which reflects the meritocratic sorting process, has come under criticism for being rigid and unable to accurately assess many valuable qualities and potentials of students. Education theorist Bill Ayers, commenting on the limitations of standardized testing, writes that "Standardized tests can't measure initiative, creativity, imagination, conceptual thinking, curiosity, effort, irony, judgment, commitment, nuance, good will, ethical reflection, or a host of other valuable dispositions and attributes. What they can measure and count are isolated skills, specific facts and function, content knowledge, the least interesting and least significant aspects of learning."[54] Merit determined through the opinionated evaluations of teachers, while being able to assess the valuable qualities that cannot be assessed by standardized testing, are unreliable as the opinions, insights, biases, and standards of the teachers vary greatly. If the system of evaluation is corrupt, non-transparent, opinionated or misguided, decisions regarding who has the highest merit can be highly fallible.

. *Alienation of the worker from their product:* The design and development of a production rest not in the hands of a worker but within the decisions of the capitalists. A worker does not have control over what he or she intends to produce or the specifications of his or her product.
** unfulfilled needs: autonomy, importance of the workers needs, freedom, direct democracy, incluson, integration, power with, choice, spontaneity

. *Alienation of the worker from the act of production:* The production of goods and services within a capitalist society is repetitive and mechanical that offers little to no psychological satisfaction to the worker. Labor seems coerced because a worker undertakes this as a means of survival.
** unfulfilled needs: sense, freedom, creativity, safety, willingness, voluntariness, importance of the workers needs, power with, enjoyment, fulfilment

. *Alienation of the worker from their species-essence:* The species-essence or “Gattungswesen” of an individual comprises all of his or her innate potentials. Under a capitalist mode of production, an individual losses identity and the opportunity for self-development as he or she is forced to sell his or her labor-power as a market commodity.
** unfulfilled needs: creativity, connection with the worker's feelings and needs - with the life inside, sense, meaning, enjoyment, growth, development, identity, choice, strength, fulfilment, *empathy*

. *Alienation of the worker from other workers:* The reduction of labor to a mere market commodity creates the so-called labor market in which a worker competes against another worker. Labor is traded in a competitive labor market instead of considering it as a constructive socioeconomic activity characterized by collective common effort.
** unfulfilled needs: community

    *** one of severe pieces of evidence pointing to a new and surprising scientific consensus: *Traumatic events ... can alter the brain's chemistry.*
    *** By the 1980s, evidence from studies with laboratory animals was pointing to a specific site of those brain changes: the noradrenaline system, which rouses the body for emergencies. *Trauma seems to reset the brain's noradrenaline system, making people prone to adrenaline surges even decades later.* Such surges can be triggered by anything resembling the original trauma--or they can come out of the blue.
    *** Other studies at the West Haven research center show that a trauma could sensitize people to adrenaline. In one, John Mason, M.D., found that *PTSD sufferers had abnormally high levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline in their bodies.*
    *** These changes may also occur in the locus coeruleus, which coordinates the secretion of the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline, which course through the body to prepare it for an emergency. About 90 percent of the cells for the brain's noradrenaline-controlling system are in the locus coeruleus or connect directly to it. One major trunk of these connections runs to the limbic system, the system that modulates emotions; another runs to the frontal cortex, which involves planning and rational decision-making.
    *** In other words, *researchers found a series of neurobiological changes that left PTSD sufferers with an altered brain metabolism--vulnerable to surges of noradrenaline--thus prompting the alarm states. [maybe alarm states of helplessness, frustration, tension and consequent burnout?]*
    *** ... one clue may come from dozens of studies with animals that show that *suffering severe trauma in early life increases susceptibility to the impact of other trauma later on.* One implication is that *people who were victims of abuse as children may be among the most vulnerable to PTSD as adults.* "*Once you're exposed to early kinds of stresses, you're more reactive to later ones*," says the VA's Dr. Krystal.
    *** As researchers have focused on trauma and the brain, they have found two other major shifts in addition to the *noradrenaline system's increased vulnerability to adrenaline rushes*: One of the main changes is in the brain circuit linking the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. During stress, this circuit triggers the release of CRF, an important stress hormone. *Trauma seems to leave this brain system prone to oversecreting CRF, thereby reacting to emergencies that do not exist in reality.*

=== Burnout

Psychologists Herbert Freudenberger and Gail North developed a 12-stage model of burnout:

. The Compulsion to Prove Oneself: demonstrating worth obsessively; self-esteem directly linked to work performance
. Working Harder and Longer: an inability to switch off; thoughts and worries of work take over even during evenings and weekends
. Neglecting Own Needs: erratic sleeping, eating too much or too little, diminished social interaction, neglecting hobbies or pastimes, spending less quality time with loved ones
. Displacement of Conflicts: problems are dismissed; may feel threatened, judged, panicky, and jittery.
. Revision of Values: Values are skewed, friends and family dismissed, hobbies are seen as indulgent or irrelevant. Work is the only focus.
. Denial of Emerging Problems: intolerance; perceiving colleagues as stupid, lazy, demanding, or undisciplined; cynicism, aggression; problems are viewed as caused by time pressure and work.
. Withdrawal: quality social or family life small or nonexistent;
. Odd Behavioral Changes: changes in behaviour; friends and family concerned.
. Depersonalization: seeing neither self nor others as valuable, can no longer perceive own needs.
. Inner Emptiness: feeling empty inside and to overcome this, look for activities such as overeating, sex, alcohol, or drugs; activities are often exaggerated.
. Depression: feeling lost and unsure, exhausted, future feels bleak and dark.
. Burnout Syndrome: can include total mental and physical collapse; medical intervention essential.

It is a frightening scale. Left to snowball, the increasing severity of symptoms can result in a complete mental, emotional, and physical breakdown. The startling effects of burnout syndrome can result in major depressive disorder, anxiety, panic attacks, increased risk of heart disease, family breakdown, divorce and even suicide.

Step one on the scale, “the compulsion to prove oneself”, gives the biggest clue to the type of person most at risk of burnout and why. The biggest risk factor for burnout is the tendency to prioritise work achievement above all else in one’s life. If the majority of one’s self-esteem is gained through career progression and achievement it can be difficult not to let hard work metastasise into life-ruining burnout.

University of California Berkeley professor emerita and American social psychologist Christina Maslach’s research on burn-out defines it as a prolonged response to chronic emotional and interpersonal stressors. It manifests in a few key aspects, through physical and emotional exhaustion, socially dysfunctional behaviour and psychological impairment, and fuels organisational inefficiency. [And time managmeent doesn't relief the physical and psychological exhaustion anyway. link:https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/22/why-time-management-is-ruining-our-lives[Why time management is ruining our lives]]

According to our results, the *most common reason* cited for working to burnout was to hit deadlines. Thirty-eight percent of respondents said that was one of the reasons they worked to burnout.

The *second most common reason* was to maintain productivity stats. Thirty-four percent of our respondents said that was why they worked to burnout, so our data appear to back up that sentiment.

Fear of being fired was actually the *third most common reason* respondents gave for working until burnout. Thirty-three percent of employees admitted this was one of the reasons they did so.

It’s notable that *the top three reasons all center on maintaining productivity, meeting deadlines, and fear*. The more rewards-based incentives, like working toward a promotion or for a raise, ranked significantly lower on the list. We believe that reveals something interesting about the mind-set of employees today.

_What can employers do to get an understanding of what this situation is like at their workplace?_

Employers can start by talking to their employees. This can be done in a number of ways, ranging from anonymous surveys to more formal question-and-answer sessions. It depends on the culture of the company. But ultimately, if employers want to know how their employees are feeling, the best way to find out is to ask the source.

*_How can employers begin to address some of the issues highlighted in these findings?_*

*They can start by asking themselves tough questions. What type of example are they setting? Do leaders visibly take vacation, or do they perpetuate a culture of work martyrdom?*

*Culture is set from the top down, and if employers are unhappy with the culture their employees feel, the first and hardest step is to honestly look in the mirror.*

Like Dave, those who are burnt-out typically report feeling perpetually tired, drained and lacking in enthusiasm. Mood difficulties are common within this population, with studies reporting that up to nine in 10 of burnt-out workers meet diagnostic criteria for depression.
Many of them gradually withdraw from social activities and become increasingly isolated. Often, burnt-out workers spend more time on work but yet find that their output and morale are worse than their less-stressed colleagues.

New York Times journalist Erin Griffith recently described the artificially glorified state of ambition in our society as having mutated from being a means to an end into a lifestyle. Mantras such as “Don’t stop when you’re tired, stop when you’re done” also bolster assumptions that employees are only valuable insofar as they are productive.

In summary, burn-out operates on a vicious cycle in our society perpetuated by factors including poor organisational culture, unrealistic expectations of workers’ productivity, role ambiguity and lack of recognition and management. This leads to a feeling of a lack of control over one’s situation that, over the long term, drives workers towards burn-out.
Physical signs often include exhaustion or fatigue and somatic problems (e.g. neckaches, backpain). Those who suffer from it also have a lack of motivation, experience more negative emotions (e.g. anger, frustration, irritation) and have cognitive difficulties.

In fact, the National Workplace Safety and Health Research Agenda for Singapore (2018-2020) published by the Workplace Safety and Health Institute revealed that organisational politics, workload and lack of support were the top three factors contributing to workplace stress.
Organisations must treat employees as the soul of their company, rather than as resources to be expended at their disposal, says IMH’s Sara-Ann Lee.

Ultimately, organisations should not lose sight of the largest piece in the puzzle – engagement.  Indeed, organisations should tread cautiously and strive to achieve a balance between increasing productivity and deleteriously endorsing a hustle culture.

** Yet if the ethos of efficiency and productivity risks prioritising the health of the economy over the happiness of humans, it is also true that the sense of pressure it fosters is not much good for business, either. This, it turns out, is a lesson business is not especially keen to learn.
** he started arguing that ramping up the time pressure on your employees was a terrible way to drive such projects forward. What was needed, he had come to realise, was not an increased focus on using time efficiently. It was the opposite: *more slack*.
** “The best companies I visited, all through the years, were never very hurried,” DeMarco said. “Maybe they used pressure from time to time, as a sort of amusing side-effect. But it was never a constant. Because you don’t get creativity for free. You need people to be able to sit back, put their feet up, and think.” Manual work can be speeded up, at least to a certain extent, by increasing the time pressure on workers. But *good ideas do not emerge more rapidly when people feel under the gun – if anything, the good ideas dry up*.
** Part of the problem is simply that thinking about time encourages clockwatching, which has been repeatedly shown in studies to undermine the quality of work.
** The mere awareness of their limited time triggered anxious emotions that got in the way of performance.
** The more efficiently they manage their time, the fuller their schedule will be ...
** *“An organisation that can accelerate but not change direction is like a car that can speed up but not steer,” DeMarco writes.* “In the short run, it makes lots of progress in whatever direction it happened to be going. *In the long run, it’s just another road wreck.” He often uses the analogy of those sliding number puzzles, in which you move eight tiles around a nine-tile grid, until all the digits are in order. To use the available space more efficiently, you could always add a ninth tile to the empty square. You just wouldn’t be able to solve the puzzle any more. If that jammed and unsolvable puzzle feels like an appropriate metaphor for your life, it’s hard to see how improving your personal efficiency – trying to force yet more tiles on to the grid – is going to be much help.*
** [Time management, efficiency and personal productivity] is a convenient ideology from the point of view of those who stand to profit from our working harder, and our increased capacity for consumer spending.

The vagus nerve is the tenth of twelve pairs of cranial nerves and is the longest in the body. In fact, the word vagus means “vagabond” in Latin, and shows perfectly  the path of this nerve extending through various organs of the body.

The vagus nerve starts in the cranial box, exactly in the spinal cord, and falls into the neck developing in two branches and reaching the abdomen passing through various organs on its way.

The vagus nerve intervenes in the sensitivity of the respiratory mucous membranes and transmits the rhythm, strength and frequency of breathing.

It affects pharynx, larynx, esophagus, trachea and bronchi, as well as nerve fibers of the heart, stomach, pancreas and liver. But it also does the inverse work; that is, it receives signals from the internal organs and sends them to the brain to be processed.

Although perhaps *the most interesting thing is the relationship between the vagus nerve and anxiety, as it also transmits signals of nervousness or calm, anger or relaxation.*

To understand the link between the vagus nerve and anxiety we need to know that the nervous system is made up of two “opposite” systems that constantly send information to the brain.

The sympathetic nervous system prepares us for action, so it mainly feeds hormones like adrenaline and cortisol. The parasympathetic nervous system intervenes in rest and relaxation.

In practice, both systems work as accelerator and decelerator. The sympathetic nervous system accelerates and activates us as the parasympathetic nervous system helps us relax and reduce the speed, so it uses neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, which decreases the heart rate and blood pressure for the organs to function slower.

The functions of the vagus nerve
The vagus nerve controls the parasympathetic system. It intervenes in many functions, from mouth movements to heartbeat, and likewise, when affected ​​it can cause various symptoms. Some of the vagus nerve functions in our body are:

– It helps regulate heartbeat, controls muscle movements and maintains the pace of breathing.

– It maintains the functioning of the digestive tract, allowing the contraction of the stomach and intestine muscles to digest food.

– Facilitates relaxation after a stressful situation or indicates that we are in danger and we do not have to lower the guard.

– Send sensory information to the brain about organ status.

Vagus nerve and anxiety
*When we are subjected to stressful situations is activated the sympathetic nervous system. If the tension persists and we cannot turn off the physiological response that triggers it, it won’t pass much time before problems appear.*

At brain level, this involves the activation of two pathways: the *hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis* and the *brain-intestine axis*.

The brain responds to stress and anxiety by increasing the production of hormones (CRFs) that goes from the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland where induces the release of another hormone (ACTH), which in turn goes through the bloodstream to adrenal glands *stimulating cortisol and adrenaline induction*.

These act as immune system suppressors and inflammatory precursors, which is why when we feel stressed and anxious we get ill easily and, ultimately, we can end up suffering depression, a mental disorder that has been linked to an inflammatory brain response.

And if it were not enough, *chronic stress [burnout] and anxiety cause* an increase in glutamate in the brain, a neurotransmitter that, when produced in excess, causes *migraine, depression and anxiety*.

In addition, a *high level of cortisol reduces the volume of the hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for the formation of new memories*.

The involvement of the vagus nerve will lead to symptoms such as dizziness, gastrointestinal problems, arrhythmias, breathing difficulties, and disproportionate emotional responses.

In fact, as the vagus nerve is unable to activate the relaxation signal, the sympathetic nervous system keeps active, this will cause the person to respond impulsively and suffer anxiety.

It is also curious that a study developed at the *University of Miami* found that the *vagal tone is transmitted from mother to child*. *Women suffering from anxiety, depression or experiencing anger during pregnancy had a lower vagal activity and their children also shown low vagal activity and lower levels of dopamine and serotonin.*

Children with more secure attachments with their mothers exhibited greater empathetic responsiveness, less social inhibition, and higher vagal tone. +

Even if your vagus nerve isn’t damaged, you may experience poor vagal tone. Symptoms of poor vagal tone even without nerve damage may include:

Anxiety
Depression
Poor emotional regulation
High stress
Being in flight-or-fight mode
Lowered attention span
Increased inflammation 
Pain

HRV is reported to be an index of the influence of both the parasympathetic nervous system and the sympathetic nervous systems.[16] Different aspects of psychology represent the balance of these two influences. For example, high HRV is shown proper emotion regulation, decision-making, and attention, and low HRV reflects the opposite.[16]

Previous research has suggested that a large part of the attention regulation is due to the default inhibitory properties of the prefrontal cortex.[16]

All too often, the readily accessible power of the vagus nerve to lower anxiety and reduce inflammation is overlooked and underestimated. I’ve written posts here that highlight practical ways to tap into the ability of your vagus nerve to combat the cortisol-producing stress response of fight-or-flight.

*The vagus nerve is the prime driving force of the parasympathetic nervous system which regulates our “rest-and-digest” or “tend-and-befriend” responses.* On the flip side, to maintain homeostasis, the sympathetic nervous system drives the “fight-or-flight” response. Ideally, within your autonomic nervous system, the tug of war between these two polar opposite mechanisms creates a "yin-yang" type of harmony marked by homeostatic balance.

Additionally, *the individualistic "every man for himself" zeitgeist undermines collective “tending-and-befriending” and can put someone's fight-or-flight response in constant hyperdrive with no reprieve.*

Today’s blog is for the “doers”, the “givers”—for those of you who find relaxation to be unproductive and tend to work way beyond 40 hours a week at your job, with your children, around the house, caregiving, listening to friends or family member’s problems or whatever it is that keeps you “on.”

We’re discussing the nervous system and why it is essential to support yours, so you do not become what’s called “*sympathetic dominant*.” This is a term which refers to someone who is stuck in “fight-or-flight” mode and can’t find their off switch.

Working, texting, driving, kids, fighting with your spouse, family, or other family members,  intense exercise—these all shift us OUT of rest and digest into “fight-or-flight” mode.

*The body cannot function properly, let alone heal when it is in “fight-or-flight” mode ...*

*Moving into a state of rest and digest is pivotal in ALL healing protocols AND a crucial aspect of being able to CHOOSE happiness no matter WHAT is going on in your life.* [Let the Nonviolent Communication help me with that and receiving events and response as a gift full of needs which I can accept or give back gracefully, although sometimes is hard to see the beauty in the needs and see them as beautiful gifts when they're expressed in a way that I can't at the moment translate into the language of life - into Nonviolent Communication - into the language of feelings and needs and possible requests.]

The autonomic nervous system regulates the function of our internal organs, such as our stomach, lungs, and heart. Essentially, it keeps the show running without us having to do anything, even while we are sleeping. *[The background thread of our body]*

Within the autonomic nervous system, there are two branches: the sympathetic nervous system (arousing/fight-or-flight) and *the parasympathetic nervous system (calming/rest-digest-heal)*.

The parasympathetic nervous system is all about rest and relaxation, which is essential for proper digestion and healthy reproduction.

When we are in a consistent state of “fight-or-flight,” this can lead to:

* Digestive issues such as constipation and bloating, *despite a healthy balanced diet*. Stress is one of the most common reasons for constipation and is a focus  within all of our programs.
* Feelings of not being able to calm down or slow down mentally and physically.

*All healing occurs in a parasympathetic state; this includes healthy digestion, detoxification, and cellular regeneration.*

While both nervous systems are working simultaneously, there is always one which is more active. Almost like yin and yang, when we have a healthy balance between the two it allows our body to be at ease and able to heal.

We can become sympathetic dominant by working too hard, receiving too much stimulation from phones, computers and technology, over-exercising, or just being too stressed in general.

Someone who is sympathetic dominant usually has a hard time relaxing; they are always working. *Our 21st-century lifestyles have set up our nervous systems to be more sympathetic dominant* but with some consciousness around it and consistent positive lifestyle and dietary choices, we can support our bodies back into homeostasis.

1: Meditation And Breathwork 

3: Cold Showers
Cold water stimulates our immune system and activates our vagus nerve, which reduces our stress response. This is a nerve that is part of our autonomic nervous system and the nerve that connects the brain and digestive tract. Think of it as the communication highway between your brain and gut.

*The vagus nerve regulates our heart rate and our digestive system and how each function.*

*If our vagus nerve is not working optimally, it can lead to slowed motility in our gut, weight gain, anxiety, high-stress, and nutrient deficiencies. This makes it easy to understand the long-term digestive effects of stress, including irritable bowel syndrome, colitis, and SIBO.*

4: Supporting Your Sleep Cycle
Striving for a balanced circadian rhythm is essential for healing and building a strong immune system. When we are sleep-deprived, we have increased levels of stress hormones and poor cognitive health. The majority of us need 8-9 hours of sleep a night, yet the typical American sleeps 4-6 hours a night. Add a lavender diffuser to your bedroom, and be sure to turn off all screens one hour before bedtime. Also make time to watch our Food as Medicine episode on this topic called Understanding Circadian Rhythm and Sleep where we give you practical, food-based ways to do this.

9: Exercise Smart
Often when we are stressed, we tend to gravitate towards cardio and high-movement activities.  While this can be healing for some, many people find this to be too stimulating and taxes their adrenals and nervous system even more. A grounding type exercise such as yoga, walking, or pilates can be very nourishing to a nervous system stuck in fight-or-flight. Remember, stress (and cortisol) is addictive so we often crave what will continue our imbalance, such as running fast or kick-boxing, which might stimulate us vs. engaging in an exercise better suited to downregulate an overactive nervous system.

Excerpts (Auszüge) von meinem Tagebuch

Ich zahle jetzt für alles, wofür ich mich geopfert habe. Ich bekam eine Krankheit mit der Verdauung. Es geht darum, dass meine Verdauung langsamer wurde und einen Magengeschür bekam, und Sodbrennen - hauptsächlich hinter dem Gaumen - am jeden Morgen habe, und mich bei Verdauung verschiedener Lebensmittel aufbläst. Reizdarmsyndrom heißt das eigentlich. Klassische Therapie aus der Gastroenterologie hat nicht funktioniert seit über zwei Jahre. Sie haben die Symptome gedämptf, statt die Ursache zu heilen. Aber die Ursache ist nicht in Därmen. Ich bin überzeugt, dass die Ursache in meinem Kopf, in meinem Gehirn, in meiner Denkweise versteckt ist. Konkret mit einem der Hirnnerven: Nervus vagus. Er steuert die Aktivität der inneren Organen. Er aktiviert sich, wenn wir relaxieren oder schlafen. Bis März 2019 hatte ich wenig Erholung. Ich arbeitete hart [in Scheidt & Bachmann], ich bemühte mich so viel, wie ich es nur schaffte. Ich opferte mich. Ich wurde krank. Ich spürte Nervosität, Angst, Sorgen in meinem Magen und Därmen. Angst vor Bewertungen und Urteilen. Nervus vagus steuert auch diese innere Organe. Meine Denkweise unterstützte mich, nie zufrieden zu sein, immer Fehler zu suchen, Anderen kritisieren, verurteilen, analysieren und diagnostizieren. Ich hatte Angst, was die Anderen über mich denken, statt mich auf unsere Gefühle und Bedürfnisse zu konzentrieren. Ich dachte an alle meine Aufgaben, die ich vollbringen muss und machen soll. Ich dachte mir, dass ich nicht zum Auswahl hatte. Ich muss der Autoritäten gehorchen sein. Mit all diesen Überzeugungen, und Glaubenssätzen habe ich die Ruhe, Frieden und Epathie in mir blockiert. Das blockiert auch der Nervus Vagus, der sich ausschließlich bei Ruhe, Frieden und Empathie aktiviert. Wenn die äußere Umgebung auch diese gewalttätige Denkweise unterstützt und das länger dauert, wird man krank. So wie ich. Als ich die Gewaltfreie Kommunikation gefunden habe, fühlte ich mich erleichtert ... auch wenn ich mir Materialien gemacht habe undd die Arbeit von Marshall B. Rosenberg gefolgt habe, weil [Gewaltfreie Kommunikation es so viele von meinen Grundbedürfnissen erfüllt, eine neue Art Ehrlichkeit gezeigt hat und mich vom Selbstmord gerettet hat.]

Excerpts vom Email an Herrn Baláž

Tiež praktizujem "nenásilnú komunikáciu", aby som upokojil myseľ. Tá potom stimuluje blúdivý nerv, nervus vagus, ktorý riadi činnosť vnútorností.
Lebo móžem neviem ako športovať, rehabilitovať sa a stravovať sa, keď budem rozrušený alebo v depresii. A vplyv depresie na črevnú mikroflóru už bol preskúmaný - medzi nimi je pozitívna korelácia. Čím hlbší smútok, tým väčšia disbióza.
Keď to nie je blúdivým nervom, tak ja už neviem čím. Lebo hlavne ten je zodpovedný za činnosť žliaz a vnútorností. A je to hlavné spojenie medzi vnútornosťami a mozgom (lebo nervus vagus e nerv vychádzajúci z mozgu).
Takže toto je pekný príklad toho, ako myslenie a duševný stav človeka ovplyvňuje jeho fyzické zdravie. Škoda, že ma v škole nenaučili jednoducho sa stravovaniu, nenásilnú komunikáciu, jógu a pilates. Lebo aj tieto veci sú prevenciou.
Trávenie sa postupne posilňuje a upokojuje. Nervozita a napätie, ktoré som cítil v žalúdku, sa výrazne zmiernili. Pripisujem to intenzívnemu tréningu nenásilnej komunikácie.

Wenn dein Körper im Stress ist, ist auch das weniger bekannte Noradrenalin wichtig. Es ist ein Neurotransmitter und sorgt dafür, dass die Stress-Information vom Nervensystem weitergeleitet wird. So erhält dein Körper die Information, Adrenalin zu aktivieren.

Zusätzlich stößt der Körper bei Stress Cortisol aus. Es hat eine ähnliche Wirkung wie Adrenalin, ist zusätzlich entzündungshemmend und macht das Immunsystem schwächer.

Wie bereits erwähnt, schüttet der Körper in Stresssituationen Adrenalin aus. Wenn du zu viel Adrenalin ausstößt, denkt dein Körper, er befindet sich dauerhaft im Stress. Da durch den erhöhten Adrenalinspiegel der Blutzucker und der Blutdruck erhöht sind, das Immunsystem gehemmt und der Stoffwechsel angeregt ist, hat dies Auswirkungen auf deinen gesundheitlichen und psychischen Zustand.

Cortisol hat eine ähnliche Wirkung wie Adrenalin. Auch Cortisol schüttet das Nervensystem bei Stress aus. Es hemmt das Immunsystem, wirkt gegen Entzündungen und vermindert Überreaktionen des Körpers.

Sport - balanciert den Adrenalinspiegel aus, *Leistungssport sollte jedoch gemieden werden* [deswegen Wettbewerb und Überlastung vermeiden]

---

High levels of cortisol can affect learning and memory, causing weight gain, high blood pressure, heart disease, depression, and psychological problems. *[How can I then concentrate on any activity, when I'm constantly feeling tense and nervous, and don't have the thinking or the environment in which I would calm down and enjoy the activities?]*

Many studies have shown that high levels of cortisol can reduce the flow of blood and glucose to the brain. This will interfere with brain activity as well as increase the number of dead cells in the brain. Hence, if the amount of cortisol is high, you will be more likely to experience anxiety, stress, and mood changes. Not only that, you are very easy to fall into depression.

Physical or psychological stress can also increase cortisol levels in the blood.

== Default Mode Network (DMN)

*or how idleness and mindfulness can be productive.*

---

*The default mode network (DMN)*, also known as the default network, *is a network of interacting brain regions known to have activity highly correlated with each other* and distinct from other networks in the brain.

*The default mode network is most commonly shown to be active when* a person is not focused on the outside world and *the brain is at wakeful rest, such as during daydreaming and mind-wandering.* But *it is also active when the individual is thinking about others* [empathy for others], *thinking about themselves* [empathy for oneself], *remembering the past* [learning], and *planning for the future* [hypothetical thinking - Sel-Directed Education (SDE) - Peter Gray - Play].

The network activates “by default” when a person is not involved in a task. Though *the DMN was originally noticed to be deactivated in certain goal-oriented tasks and is sometimes referred to as the task-negative network*, it can be active in other goal-oriented tasks such as social working memory or autobiographical tasks. *The DMN has been shown to be negatively correlated with other networks in the brain such as attention networks. [Process vs Product - so orientation to goals interferes with DMN developlent?]*

Evidence has pointed to disruptions in the DMN of people with Alzheimer’s and autism spectrum disorder.

=== Function Of The Default Mode Network

The default mode network is known to be involved in many seemingly different functions:

It is the neurological basis for the self:

* Autobiographical information: Memories of collection of events and facts about one’s self

* Self-reference: Referring to traits and descriptions of one’s self

* *Emotion of one’s self: Reflecting about one’s own emotional state* +
*Self-empathy and mindfulness?*

Thinking about others:

* Theory of Mind: Thinking about the thoughts of others and what they might or might not know

* *Emotions of other: Understanding the emotions of other people and empathizing with their feelings* +
*Does this mean that Nonviolent Communication and practicing empathy promotes the development of DMN?*

* *Moral reasoning: Determining just and unjust result of an action [Life-enriching and Life-harming or Life-destroying]*

* *Social evaluations: Good-bad attitude judgments about social concepts [Life-enriching and Life-harming or Life-destroying]*

* Social categories: Reflecting on important social characteristics and status of a group

Remembering the past and thinking about the future:

* Remembering the past: Recalling events that happened in the past

* Imagining the future: Envisioning events that might happen in the future

* Episodic memory: Detailed memory related to specific events in time

* Story comprehension: Understanding and remembering a narrative

The default mode network is active during passive rest and mind-wandering. Mind-wandering usually involves thinking about others, thinking about one’s self, remembering the past, and envisioning the future.

Electrocorticography studies (which involve placing electrodes on the surface of epileptic patient’s brains) have shown the default mode network becomes activated within an order of a fraction of a second after participants finish a task.

Studies have shown that when people watch a movie, listen to a story, or read a story, their DMNs are highly correlated with each other. DMNs are not correlated if the stories are scrambled or are in a language the person does not understand, suggesting that the network is highly involved in the comprehension and the subsequent memory formation of that story.

The DMN is shown to even be correlated if the same story is presented to different people in different languages, further suggesting the default mode network is truly involved in the comprehension aspect of the story and not the auditory or language aspect.

The default mode network has shown to deactivate during external goal-oriented tasks such as visual attention or cognitive working memory tasks, thus leading some researchers to label the network as the task-negative network.

However, when the tasks are external goal-oriented tasks that are known to be a role of the DMN, such as social working memory or an autobiographical task, the DMN is positively activated with the task and correlates with other networks such as the network involved in executive function.

=== Anatomy

The default mode network is an interconnected and anatomically defined set of brain regions. The network can be separated into hubs and subsections:

*Functional hubs:* Information regarding the self [reference to NVC - Self-empathy]

*Posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) & precuneus:* Combines bottom-up (not controlled) attention with information from memory and perception. The ventral (lower) part of PCC activates in all tasks which involve the DMN including those related to the self, related to others, remembering the past, thinking about future, and processing concepts plus spatial navigation. [reference to NVC - Self-empathy] +
The dorsal (upper) part of PCC [dorsal anterior cingulate cortex - ACC] involves involuntary awareness and arousal. *The precuneus is involved in visual, sensorimotor, and attentional information. [reference to Mindfulness]*

*Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC):* Decisions about self processing such as personal information, autobiographical memories, future goals and events, and decision making regarding those personally very close such as family. *The ventral (lower) part is involved in positive emotional information and internally valued reward.* +
*[So when the people are led to intrinsic motivation it is also benefitial for their brain, at least this part of the brain, and emotional regulation?* +
*Reference to Montessori Method, Alfie Kohn - Unconditional Parenting, Intrinsic motivation, M.B. Rosenberg - Life-Enriching Education]*

*Angular gyrus:* Connects perception, attention, spatial cognition, and action and helps with parts of recall of episodic memories

*Dorsal medial subsystem:* Thinking about others [NVC - Empathy for others, NVC and H. Zehr: Restorative Justice, Peter Gray - SDE - Play - Hypothetical thinking]

Functional hubs: PCC, mPFC, and angular gyrus +
Dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC): Involved in social directed thought such as determining or inferring the purpose of others' actions [reference to Attribution Theory - External Attribution, NVC - Empathy to others] +
Temporoparietal junction (TPJ): Reflects on beliefs about others, also known as theory of mind [Empathy for Others]+
Lateral temporal cortex: Retrieval of social semantic and conceptual knowledge +
Anterior temporal pole: Abstract conceptual information particularly social in nature

*Medial temporal subsystem:* Autobiographical memory and future simulations

Functional hubs: PCC, mPFC, and angular gyrus +
Hippocampus (HF+): Formation of new memories as well as remembering the past and imagining the future +
Parahippocampus (PHC): Spatial and scene recognition and simulation +
Retrosplenial cortex (RSC): Spatial navigation +
Posterior inferior parietal lobe (pIPL): Junction of auditory, visual, and somatosensory information and attention

The default mode network is most commonly defined with resting state data by putting a seed in the posterior cingulate cortex and examining which other brain areas most correlate with this area. The DMN can also be defined by the areas deactivated during external directed tasks compared to rest.

It has been shown that the default mode network exhibits the highest overlap in its structural and functional connectivity, which suggests that the structural architecture of the brain may be built in such a way that this particular network is activated by default.

In the infant brain, there is limited evidence of the default network, but default network connectivity is more consistent in children aged 9–12 years, suggesting that the default network undergoes developmental change.

Function connectivity analysis in monkeys shows a similar network of regions to the default mode network seen in humans. The PCC is also a key hub in monkeys; however, the mPFC is smaller and less well connected to other brain regions, largely because human’s mPFC is much larger and well developed.

Diffusion MRI imaging shows white matter tracts connecting different areas of the DMN together. The structural connections found from diffusion MRI imaging and the functional correlations from resting state fMRI show the highest level of overlap and agreement within the DMN areas. This provides evidence that neurons in the DMN regions are linked to each other through large tracts of axons and this causes activity in these areas to be correlated with one another.

=== Pathology

The default mode network has been hypothesized to be relevant to disorders including Alzheimer’s disease, autism, schizophrenia, depression, chronic pain and others.

People with Alzheimer’s disease show a reduction in glucose (energy use) within the areas of the default mode network. These reductions start off as slight decreases in mild patients and continue to large reductions in severe patients. Surprisingly, disruptions in the DMN begin even before individuals show signs of Alzheimer’s disease.

Plots of amyloid-beta, which is thought to cause Alzheimer’s disease, show the buildup of the protein is within the DMN. This prompted Randy Buckner and colleagues to propose the high metabolic rate from continuous activation of DMN causes more amyloid-beta protein to accumulate in these DMN areas.

These amyloid-beta proteins disrupt the DMN and because the *DMN is heavily involved in memory formation and retrieval*, this disruption leads to the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.

DMN is thought to be disrupted in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. These individuals are impaired in social interaction and communication which are tasks central to this network.

Studies have shown worse connections between areas of the DMN in individuals with autism, especially between the mPFC (involved in thinking about the self and others) and the PCC (the central core of the DMN). The more severe the autism, the less connected these areas are to each other. It is not clear if this is a cause or a result of autism.

*Lower connectivity was found across the default network in people who have experienced long term trauma, such as childhood abuse or neglect, and is associated with dysfunctional attachment patterns.* Among people experiencing posttraumatic stress disorder, *lower activation was found in the posterior cingulate gyrus compared to controls*. *Hyperconnectivity* of the default network *has been linked to rumination in depression and chronic pain.*

=== Modulation

The default mode network (DMN) may be modulated by the following interventions and processes:

*Acupuncture*

Deactivation of the limbic brain areas and the DMN. It has been suggested that this is due to the pain response.

*Meditation*

Structural changes in areas of the DMN such as the temporoparietal junction, posterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus have been found in meditation practitioners. There is reduced activation and reduced functional connectivity of the DMN in long-term practitioners.

Various forms of nondirective meditation, including Transcendental Meditation and Acem Meditation, have been found to activate the DMN.

*Sleeping And Resting Wakefulness*

In resting wakefulness, functional connectivity between nodes of the DMN is strong. The onset of sleep is associated with a decrease in connectivity between the DMN and the task-positive network.

In stage N2 of NREM sleep, decrease in connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex. In stage N3 of NREM sleep there are further decreases in connectivity between the PCC and MPFC.

In REM sleep, there is a possible increase in connectivity between nodes of the DMN. Functional connectivity between nodes of the DMN in their resting-state is usually strong, but sleep deprivation results in a decrease in connectivity within the DMN. Recent studies also suggest a decrease in connectivity between the DMN and the task-positive network as a result of sleep loss.

* [Are *pineal gland and pituitary gland (hypophisis)* also involved in sleeping patterns and DNF functioning?]

=== Default Mode Network History

*Hans Berger*, the inventor of the electroencephalogram, was the first to propose the idea that *the brain is constantly busy*. In a series of papers published in *1929* he showed that the electrical oscillations detected by his device do not cease even when the subject is at rest. However, his ideas were not taken seriously, and a general perception formed among neurologists that only when a focused activity is performed does the brain (or a part of the brain) become active.

In the 1950s, to the surprise of the researchers, Louis Sokoloff and his colleagues noticed metabolism in the brain stayed the same when a person went from a resting state to performing effortful math problems suggesting active metabolism in the brain must also be happening during rest.

In the 1970s, Ingvar and colleagues observed blood flow in the front part of the brain became the highest when a person is at rest. Around the same time, intrinsic oscillatory behavior in vertebrate neurons was observed in cerebellar Purkinje cells, inferior olivary nucleus and thalamus.

In the 1990s, with the advent of positron emission tomography (PET) scans, researchers began to notice that when a person is involved in perception, language, and attention tasks the same brain areas become less active compared to passive rest, and labeled these areas as becoming “deactivated”.

Later, experiments by neurologist Marcus E. Raichle’s lab at Washington University School of Medicine and other groups showed that the brain’s energy consumption is increased by less than 5% of its baseline energy consumption while performing a focused mental task. These experiments showed that the brain is constantly active with a high level of activity even when the person is not engaged in focused mental work. Research thereafter focused on finding the regions responsible for this constant background activity level.

Raichle coined the term “default mode” in 2001 to describe resting state brain function; the concept rapidly became a central theme in neuroscience. Around this time, the idea was implanted that this network of brain areas is involved in internally directed thoughts and is suspended during specific goal-directed behaviors.

In 2003, Greicius and colleagues examined resting state fMRI scans and looked at how correlated different sections in the brain are to each other and found the correlation maps showed the same areas Raichle found active during rest and that others found to deactivated. It was important because it demonstrated a convergence of methods all lead to the same areas being involved in the DMN. Since then other resting state networks (RSNs) have been found, such as visual, auditory, and attention networks, some of them are often anti-correlated with the default mode network.

In the beginning to mid 2000s, researches labeled the *default mode network* as the *task negative network [TNN]* because *it was deactivated when participants had to perform tasks*. *DMN was thought to only be active during passive rest and then turned off during externally focused goal-directed tasks.* *However, studies have demonstrated the DMN to be active in external goal-directed tasks which is known to involve the DMN* such as *social working memory* or *autobiographical tasks*.

Around 2007, the number of papers referencing the default mode network  skyrocketed. All years prior to 2007, there were 12 papers published that referenced “default mode network” or “default network” in the title, however, between 2007 and 2014 there were 1384 papers published. One reason for the increase in papers is a result of the robust effect of finding the DMN with resting state scans.

Another reason is the DMN can be measured with a short and effortless resting state scans meaning they can be performed on any population including young children, clinical populations, and nonhuman primates. A third reason is role of the DMN has been expanded to more than just a passive brain network.

The DMN is also thought to play a role, in combination with other brain networks, in key human qualities such as *creativity*. As a person idles and her mind drifts, the activity of the DMN may help give rise ideas that other networks then vet and process further. [This is why the best ideas arise usually when people don't work, but usually by accident or when they're washing their teeth, daydream or just laying down.]

*Mindfulness-Based Exposure Therapy*

This 16-week nontrauma-focused intervention was developed by the authors at the VA Ann Arbor, incorporating mindfulness training from MBCT [Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy], PTSD [Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder] psychoeducation, and in vivo exposure from PE [psychoeducation] therapy, and *self-compassion exercises*. In vivo exposures were conducted only to avoided (and objectively safe) situations or activities. It was explicitly stated that no imaginal exposure or processing of trauma memories would be done in this group. *The intervention consists of four “modules”:* +
*(1) PTSD psychoeducation and relaxation,* +
*(2) mindfulness of body and breath exercises and in vivo exposure,* +
*(3) mindfulness of emotion in vivo exposure* and +
*(4) self-compassion training.* +
*The classes were 2 hr each and participants complete daily homework in between sessions.*

*Results*

*MBET* (N = 14) was associated with a *significant decrease in PTSD symptom severity* and PCGT was associated (N = 9) with a *trend level improvement* (Table 2 and Fig. 1). *MBET showed a significant reduction in total CAPS score [Clinician Administered PTSD Scale]* (pre vs. post MBET t(13) = 3.20, P = .007, average 15.6 point decrease in total CAPS, effect size Cohen’s d = 0.92).

*Discussion*

This study presents evidence of changes in DMN rsFC in combat veteran PTSD patients following a 16-week group psychotherapy that involved *daily mindfulness training (MBET) [Mindfulness-Based Exposure Therapy]*. PTSD *patients who completed MBET showed increased* pre- to posttherapy DMN (PCC seed) *connectivity to DLPFC regions within the CEN [Central Executive Network]*. This *increased DMN–CEN connectivity was seen only in the group who had engaged in mindfulness training*, and not in those who had completed an active control therapy (PCGT), and a treatment-group (MBET vs. PCGT) x time (post- vs. pretherapy) interaction was observed in whole brain analyses. These findings are consistent with the long-standing concept that the prolonged forms of attention training found in mindfulness-based intervention might lead to increased capacity to volitionally switch ones attention from “narrative” forms of self-referential states (which can be associated with anxiety and rumination), to other forms of self-referential states, such as “experiencing” sensation and interoception.[23, 24] *This is consistent with the primary skills explicitly trained in mindfulness training: developing metacognitive awareness of one’s attention and the capacity to volitionally “shift” one’s attention from “mind-wandering” self-narrative to explicit tasks of interoception and attention to breath (i.e., to the object of meditation, the sensations of the breath).* *Increased recruitment of executive network circuits _[reference to Self-Directed Executive Functioning - Play - Peter Gray - Self-Directed Education (SDE)]_* (and in particular, with DLPFC regions associated with volitional control of attention) during resting state could reflect a potential mechanism underlying the salutary effects of *mindfulness training* on *emotional regulation*, involving *increased volitional control of mental states*.

*Mindfulness-based exposure and response groups*

The MB-ERP [Mindfulness-Based Exposure and Response Prevention] group will be provided with 10 sessions of mindfulness-based behaviour therapy (ERP), each session lasting two hours. Session 1 will introduce the rationale for ERP alongside the rationale for including mindfulness principles and practice. Sessions 2 to 9 will each start with a 10-minute mindfulness practice: mindfulness of the breath and body (session 1); mindfulness of the breath, body, sounds and thoughts (sessions 2-3); mindfulness of thoughts (session 4-5); and mindfulness of body, thoughts, urges and action (sessions 6-10). Mindfulness practice will be followed by a 20-minute Socratic inquiry about the practices in order to draw out learning, with a particular emphasis on the three areas noted above: non-judgmental acceptance of (intrusive) thoughts, non-judgmental acceptance of physical sensations (of anxiety) and a recognition that it is possible to choose whether or not to follow behavioural urges (to engage in compulsive behaviours). A three-minute mindfulness breathing space practice [12] will also be introduced from session 6 onwards for participants to use on a daily basis to bring awareness to current experiences and to facilitate engagement in ERP tasks. In session 1, participants will be given an MP3 player with the range of mindfulness practices for daily home practice, with practice being recorded in the daily diary. The final 90 minutes of MB-ERP session will follow the same ERP protocol outlined above with the addition that whilst engaging in ERP tasks, *participants will be encouraged to bring mindfulness skills to the tasks*. In particular, this will involve an *encouragement to bring mindfulness to intrusive thoughts as they arise* (allowing thoughts to arise without suppressing them or becoming absorbed with them), to bring mindfulness to physical sensations of anxiety (*noticing and accepting physical sensations of anxiety with curiosity and interest*) and to bring mindfulness to urges to engage in compulsive behaviours (noticing compulsive urges and *recognising there is a choice available* - a choice to follow the urge and a choice to allow the urge to remain, without following it). Session 10 will focus on consolidating learning from the therapy and developing a therapy blueprint for continuing MB-ERP after the therapy has concluded.

*Discussion*

*Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) is the most well-established and strongly evidenced psychological therapy for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).* However, the approach is challenging for patients because *it involves* them directly and regularly confronting their anxiety-provoking triggers and *staying with their feelings of anxiety, rather than attempting to eliminate them by engaging in compulsive behaviours*. It is perhaps not surprising, therefore, that many people refuse ERP as a treatment option [37], that about a quarter of people who do start ERP drop out [8] and that many of those who do remain engaged in therapy sessions fail to engage in the recommended regular between-session ERP tasks, which is associated with poorer therapy outcomes [10]. Taken together, around half of people with OCD fail to show recovery after ERP [7]. Mindfulness-based ERP (MB-ERP) for OCD has the potential to increase engagement with ERP and, therefore, could potentially improve therapy outcomes. *The therapy encourages patients to attend non-judgementally to their intrusive thoughts, increase their acceptance of physical sensations of anxiety, and bring greater awareness to urges to engage in compulsive behaviours.* This pilot study directly compares MB-ERP groups to standard ERP groups with the primary aim of generating effect sizes for OCD symptom severity and measures of therapy engagement in order to calculate the sample size needed for a definitive trial. The hypothesis for the definitive trial is that, in comparison to ERP, MB-ERP will lead to a greater reduction in OCD symptom severity and greater rates of participant engagement. *Exposure and Response Prevention has remained relatively unchanged since its development almost 50 years ago and yet it remains the most effective therapy for OCD [2].* Mindfulness-based ERP has the potential to enhance the effectiveness of ERP through improving participant engagement in therapy sessions and in therapy tasks. This pilot study is the first step in evaluating this possibility and the next steps will be determined by the outcomes of this study.

Luckily, that mind-wandering isn’t always on.

There are times we are free of that voice. In particular, when we are doing something active [Sympathic Nervous System; Task Positive Network (TPN)]. Something we love to do.

In those moments, we feel at our best. That’s when you are in “FLOW.”

Science defines *Flow* as an *optimal state of consciousness*. *In flow, you perform and feel your best.* The task you’re doing absorbs you so much that everything else disappears.

Even your decision-making happens effortlessly. Every decision and action flows seamlessly into the next. Flow is as close to picture-perfect decision-making as you can get. That’s why it’s called flow.

*In flow, parts of the brain*, don’t become hyperactive but they *deactivate*. *We know the name for that state as [transient hypofrontality]*. transient — meaning temporary — hypo (it means slowing doing, shut down), frontality.

Frontality refers to your prefrontal cortex or the executive function of the brain. [reference to Self-Directed Executive Functioning; Play - Peter Gray]

It’s where all our higher cognitive functions resist. Our sense of will, morality, a sense of self, complex decision-making [*inner chooser* - NVC] etcetera all comes from our PFC. It’s what makes ‘you’ human.

*Now, in flow, that area goes quiet.* +
*[So during the activity I have to silence my inner critic? Do I have to turn off my critical thinking during that activity too?]*

That also the reason time passes so strangely. We calculate time all over the prefrontal cortex/PFC. [Therefore I turned off all time indicators on my computers.]

Also, your dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex [DLPFC] — known as your inner critic [*inner educator* - NVC] — goes off.

When that happens, magic takes place. You feel instantly free of yourself. As a result, things like creativity and risk-taking go through the roof. You probably feel you’re invincible. That’s why flow is considered the most addictive state.

*The brain also produces 5 of the most potent neurochemicals.*
These are all performance-enhanced neurochemicals, but also feel-good pleasure drugs.

The brain releases neurochemicals like *norepinephrine, dopamine, anandamide, serotonin, and endorphins all together. If you were to buy a drug version of all those neurochemicals and combine them, You’d end up dead or in a coma. The brain combines these neurochemicals beautifully.*

One of those neurochemicals you’ve probably heard of called dopamine.
We associate dopamine with learning, creativity, and motivation — It makes you capable of taking in more information and process it more deeply.
And that’s just one neurotransmitter. Imagine the effect of the rest.
Unfortunately for us, the brain’s default mode is the opposite of this enjoyable state of high focus and high performance.
The good news is that meditation is as close to flowing as you can get.

A link:https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/01/eight-weeks-to-a-better-brain/[study from Harward] found that when people went through 8 weeks of meditation, critical areas of the brain that associate with *awareness*, stress, and *empathy* change.
They grew *new grey matter in* their *cerebral cortex*, which connects to attention and emotional integration [emotional regulation - inhibiory neurons].
Also, the *grey matter in the amygdala, the brain’s emotional center, deceased*.
*They gained more control over their emotions.*
*Even impulse control becomes better.*

By interviewing 500 of the top world-class performers, [Tim Ferriss] saw that the most practiced routine they have is meditation. [Just like Doug Newburg found out among world-class performers that they are mindful of their feelings. They remind themselves how they want to feel and are in the environment and among those people who stimulate these feelings.] At least 80% of them have some mindfulness practice/meditation. [Meditation in my case takes the form of passive resting: lying down; or active internal dialogue: Nonviolent Communication practice - experiencing events and responses from others as precious gifts, no matter how they're expressed because I know that they don't react to me, but to their unfulfilled needs. Because that's behind every event and response: feelings and needs. Although sometimes it takes me a while until I realize what concretely they might be and what can I do or say differently next time to live more in harmony with my needs and learn from my mistakes.]

They know that it can help them gets more control over their lives. [reference to Internal locus of control]

And that meditation can stop them from being yanked around by the voice in their head.

A common assumption that we make, somewhat subconscious, is that happiness depends on external factors such as success or things. [That's how we've been raised and educated.]

We’re chasing it hoping one day if we get it, all our problems will melt away.
It doesn’t. All we’re doing is fulfilling our pleasures/desires [fulfilling our needs] and avoiding boredom/pain [unplesant feelings]. *We’re confusing pleasure-seeking with happiness.* [Maybe because the domination systems and education system support extrinsic motivation, pleasing the authorities, habitual obedience, avoiding punishment, desire of reward and praise and chasing stars? Reference to Chasing Stars: The Myth of Talent and the Portability of Performance - Boris Groysberg]

The tendency towards negativity is what the brain’s default mode network is all about. [Yea, because many of us were educated more that anything else to worry about the future and moralistically judge others when they're not behaving 'normally' or in a way that we don't like from schools and religion. maybe nVC and compassion/empathy will help me to perceive events and responses diffently, with more compassion and tolerance to be in line with the restorative justice, protective use of force, therapy, care and rehabilitation.]

However, the brain is plastic — meaning changeable. [And maybe NVC can change the operation of the DMN and perhaps other areas of the brain.]

We can form new neural pathways to become happier. We can choose our destiny. [But before we have to be exposed from outside to the other options, otherwise we wouldn't even know about them.]

We don’t have to live our lives like we’re half dead. A happier life is one doorstep away, and meditation is knocking.

The bottom line, happiness is a skill, just like you can train your body in the gym. So you can prepare yourself to be happy. And being mindful might do the trick
However, it doesn’t mean you won’t be vulnerable. It just means your going to navigate life with a little more ease.

...in 2001 when a neurologist by the name of Dr. Marcus Raichle at Washington University revealed a network of brain structures responsible for the inattentive wandering of our minds. Furthermore, Dr. Raichle showed that these same structures were deactivated when we engage in attention-demanding tasks. He coined the term, “default mode network,” to describe the group of structures active during our “default,” inattentive state (1).

The following decade revealed many more details about the default mode network (DMN) that further validated Dr. Berger’s almost century-old (1929 paper) claim that the brain was still very much “on” even when we let our attention wander.
e
Now that we have the historical context let’s examine the importance of the DMN to mindfulness and mental health.

image:https://i2.wp.com/dailymeditate.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Default-Mode-Network.jpg?w=500&ssl=1[]

A critical point regarding [the] *relationship [between Task Positive Network (TMP) and Default Mode Network (DMN) is* that] they are *mutually exclusive*.

*The activation of the DMN inhibits the TPN and vice versa.*

In fact, *no study has demonstrated the simultaneous activation of the two networks* (4). *The relationship between the DMN and the TPN is analogous to the relationship between inhalation and exhalation: despite their intimate nature, the two cannot exist simultaneously.*

image:https://i0.wp.com/dailymeditate.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/TPN.jpg[]

*The TPN [Task Positive Network] is involved in present moment awareness.*

The TPN is engaged when we attend to the here and now. *It is the action network. [Sympathic Nervous System?]* The TPN is our direct line to mindfulness and the Present Moment in which worry and sadness cannot survive.

Why is meditation theoretically so good, so helpful, so transformative?

The good folks at link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw71zanwMnY[AsapSCIENCE] took the time to dig into the actual research into meditation ... but here are seven things that scientific research tells us about what meditation does for the body and brain.

1. *Meditation can help you deal with stress and negative emotions.*

link:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK180102/[Multiple studies have shown] that meditation can help reduce levels of depression and anxiety, along with helping people tolerate pain better. The researchers conclude that mindfulness meditation in particular might help people deal with psychological stress, though they say that more research is needed into how meditation might help lead to positive mental health (beyond reducing effects of negative stresses).

2. *At the same time, meditation could boost positive skills like memory and awareness.*

Research shows that link:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3289949/[meditators have unique brains] with well-developed areas that might be connected to the mastery of awareness and emotional control. While it's possible that people with such brains might be more likely to meditate in the first place, other link:http://www.psyn-journal.com/article/S0925-4927(10)00288-X/pdf[research does show] that after completing a meditation program there are changes in participants' brains that are connected to memory, self-awareness, and perspective.

3. *Meditating for years is associated with brain changes that help you get along with others.*

Buddhist monks and other long term meditation practitioners link:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18365029[show much more developed] brain regions associated with empathy, though the reasons for that are likely complex. link:http://www.serotonin-dojo.jp/pdf/articles_005.pdf[Researchers have seen] that meditation can also change brain waves, leading to higher levels of alpha brain waves — which are link:http://web.mst.edu/~psyworld/sleep_stages.htm[generally associated with] a state of wakeful relaxation. This can help reduce negative moods and feelings including anger, tension, and sadness.

image:https://i.insider.com/54cff7346bb3f73e481b7747?width=700&format=jpeg&auto=webp[]

The default mode network refers to a network of brain regions that are active when the mind is in a meditative state — wakeful, at rest, and not focused on external distractions. This state of mind is associated with various positive effects and with reductions in negative stresses like anxiety and depression.

4. *It doesn't take long to see meditation's benefits — just weeks can change your brain.*

link:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092549271000288X[Several studies] link:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21334442[show that after an eight-week] meditation program, participants had denser brain tissue in areas connected to learning, emotion regulation, and memory processing.

Additionally, they showed decreased amounts of grey matter in parts of the amygdala, a brain area connected to fear and stress. In a study published in link:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2840837/[Social Cognitive And Affective Neuroscience], researchers write that in general, people who stimulate an area of the brain repeatedly (generally by learning a skill) show an increase in grey matter, while not using an area of the brain *decreases grey matter in [amygdala - in the center of fear and stress]*. They write that in this case, participants who reduced their stress response the most were the ones that showed the biggest decrease in grey matter in this area of the brain.

5. *The benefits of meditation extend to other parts of your body too, including your heart.*

Mindfulness training has been link:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17107296[connected to decreased blood pressure] and a more variable heart rate — which is a good thing, meaning your body can better regulate blood flow depending on how much oxygen you need at the time. link:https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/20/can-meditation-curb-heart-attacks/[Researchers] (and the link:https://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/GettingHealthy/StressManagement/TakeActiontoControlStress/Meditation-and-Heart-Health_UCM_452930_Article.jsp[American Heart Association]) say a likely mechanism for this is that meditation could reduce the levels of stress hormones that can cause inflammation and other physical problems.

6. *There are also signs that meditation can help boost your immune system — or at least help ward off the flu.*

In a link:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12883106[study], researchers took two groups of people and had one group complete an eight week meditation course. At the end of the eight weeks, the people in the meditation group showed increased left-side brain activity. At that point, the researchers injected both groups with the flu vaccine. The meditators had a stronger immune response (their bodies produced more flu-fighting antibodies), and the higher the level of left-brain activity in general, the greater the immune response.

7. *Meditation may help prevent genetic damage.*

One link:https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.29063/abstract[study showed that cancer survivors] who completed a meditation program showed increased telomere length — telomeres are protein complexes that protect our genes, and shortened telomeres have been linked to various diseases. Researchers say that the possible mechanism for this is that reducing stress could help certain enzymes that lengthen telomeres, though more research in more diverse populations is needed.

As the video below explains, meditation can't take the place of taking care of yourself — so you should keep going to the doctor, getting exercise, and eating vegetables. It's also worth noting that much of this research is still fairly preliminary and as we learn more about the brain and how it responds to different types of activity, our perspective on how all this works could change.

But it "may be a way of working out your brain with extra health benefits. And since your brain controls all of you, why not relax and say 'Ommmm...' every once in a while."

Or for those weirded out by thinking "ommmm," just go ahead and take some time to sit and breathe.

== Why did I create this?

Chcel som sa vyliečiť z tráviacich problémov. Bolestí žalúdka, nafukovania, únavy po jedle.

Doktori to vzdali. Skúšali všetko možné. Nakoniec mi povedali: "Nevieme liečiť niečo, čo nevieme ani diagnostikovať". "Tak dík." pomyslel som si a išiel som preč.

Bol som zúfalý a vyčerpaný z choroby. Lekári tiež. Tak som po dvoch rokoch prevzal zodpovednosť za svojou liečbu do vlastných rúk. Načo sú také autority, čo mi nevedia pomôcť.

Do ďalších dvoch rokoch sa môj zdravotný stav pomaly zlepšoval. Asi som mal šťastie. Ale liečba psychosomatickej choroby, syndrómu dráždivého čreva (IBS - Irritable Bowel Syndrome), je komplikovaná a zdĺhavá. Navyše terapia na túto diagnózu nie je jednoznačne stanovená. Sú to veľmi všeobecné, nejednoznačné rady. Ak keď aj to sú aj konkrétne rady, je to skôr liečba, čiže tlmenie symptómov, nie príčiny. A nie len vnútorné, ale aj vonkajšie prostredie, hrá rovnako významnú úlohu pri liečbe. Je to aj rezonancia, súzvuk, súlad, harmónia medzi vonkajším a vnútorným prostredím. Toto tvrdenie potvrdzuje aj vedecká disciplína *epigenetika*. Ak naozaj vonkajšie prostredie ovplyvňuje biológiu človeka, t. j. jeho epigenóm, potom dokážeme vytvoriť vzťah medzi spoločnosťou a zdravím človeka, a medzi telom a dušou človeka, jeho pocitmi, potrebami, zážitkami, vnímaním vonkajšieho prostredia.

Čo vytvára našu realitu?

* Vlastné vedomosti, vnímanie, interpretácie a ďalšie vnútorné vplyvy
* Výchova
* Vzdelanie
* Vonkajšie prostredie
** Médiá
** Spoločnosť
** Kultúra
** Inštitúcie
** Náboženstvo
** a ďalšie vonkajšie vplyvy

A teraz, vďaka epigenetike vieme zmerať, od ako vonkajšie prostredie vplýva na zdravie človeka. Vieme vytvoriť spojenie medzi spoločenskými vplyvmi a biológiou človeka. link:???[(Peter Spork - Gesundheit is kein Zufall)], link:???[(Zitat  - Peter Spork - Gesundheit is kein Zufall - Verbindung zwischen Soziologie und Biologie)]

Chcel som si konečne začať užívať život, potom, čo som asi šesť krát vyhorel. Asi som vymyslel prevenciu proti vyhoreniu a zachovanie radosti zo života. Ale berte to s rezervou: žiadne, že buď 100% garancia spokojnosti, alebo vrátenie peniazí ;) Ale pomohlo mi to začať odznova. Postupne prekonávať depriesie. A menej sa nenávidieť za chyby :/ A pomaly sa liečiť z chorôb, keď lekári hovorili, že ma nevedia vyliečiť.

*I just want to be healthy and live well! Do I want so much?!link:https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/203d/index.htm[‽]*

*Why did I recreated everything to feel good again? Why isn't it here right from the beginning!?*

Lebo môžem byť neviemaký odborník, keď neviem vychádzať s ľuďmi.

To ma vždy bude vyrušovať pri učení sa čohokoľvek odborného.

Chcem sa cítiť dobre s druhými ľuďmi.

Odbornosť nie je všetko. Odbornosť je jedna časť.

Ďalšia časť je ľudskosť.

Ľudskosť rozvíjam empatiou.

Empatia mi pomáha spájať sa so sebou samým a s ostatnými ľuďmi a rozumieť dobrým dôvodom, pocitom a potrebám, prečo ľudia robia to, čo robia.

Empatia lieči rany na duši rýchlejšie a do väčšej hĺbky než psychoanalýza, pretože empatia sa zameriava na prítomnosť. Pri psychoanalýze sa rozpráva o minulosti, lenže rozprávanie o minulosti a jej analyzovanie spomaľuje liečbu a môže jej dokonca brániť. Psychoanalýza poskytuje skôr intelektuálne porozumenie než emocionálne liečenie: súcit - empatiu.

Empatia je súčasťou emocionálnej inteligencie.

Lenže väčšina škôl a väčšina pedagógov používa praktiky, ktoré bránia rozvoju empatie a emocionálnej inteligencie. Veď akoby aj mohli. Pedagógovia sa trápia, lebo oni sami nevedia veľa o emocionálnej inteligencii a jej dôležitosti, a aj väčšina školských inštitúcii je  navrhnutá tak, aby kládli väčší dôraz na výkon, výsledky, súťaživosť, povinnosť a poslušnosť, než na starostlivosť, ochotu, dobrovoľnosť, súcit a zodpovednosť.

A namiesto altruistických ľudí vychovávajú ľudí sebeckých. Lebo, čo sa asi študent naučí? *Že ostatní ľudia sú potencionálnou prekážkou k jeho/jej úspechu.* A, že *ja dokážem uspieť iba vtedy, keď druhí zlyhajú.* link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qRZt0VCak[Alfie Kohn at the OFJCC: Performance vs. Learning - The Costs of Overemphasizing Achievement], link:???[Daniel Markovits - Excellence vs Superiority]

V takomto prostredí potom trpia nielen študenti, ale aj učitelia a vedenie. Podobne vo firmách, trpia zamestnanci aj menežéri, ktorí vyznávajú túto ideológiu.

Som presvedčený, že nízka úroveň emocionálnej inteligencie a hrozba násilím umožňuje, aby sa takýto systém udržal.

A chcem sa vedieť smiať na svojich chybách. Chcem sa učiť zo svojich chýb a prestať sa nenávidieť za to, že robím chyby.

Výrazne mi v tom pomohlo štúdium a tréning nenásilnej komunikácie. Začal som v auguste 2019 _(14.8.2019)_. Pokračujem až dodnes. Vždy, keď ju použijem, uľaví sa mi. Máloktorá technika, ktorú som kedy skúšal bola tak spoľahlivá, ako je táto. Nenásilná komunikácia zvyšuje moju emocionálnu inteligenciu, vnímavosť, duševný pokoj a rovnováhu. Dáva mi nádej, že veci môžu byť aj inak. Lepšie. Udržateľné. Prospešné pre všetkých. Nielen iba pre elitu.

I do aggree with Marx on alienation. I do agree with Marx on the idea of "From each according to their abilities to each according to their needs." And that's perhaps the only things what I aggree with Marx on. But I don't aggree with Marx on any kind of violence. Even revolutions can be nonviolent. And preserve dignity and humanity of all. Marxism is only one of the pieces of the whole picture. There are many. The world is multi-layered. The life is multi-layered. There is not a single truth. There is always space for further exploration. I see a heterogenous, heterodox solutions in each empirical problem. I just hope that the needs will give me creativity.

*Sladký život*

Budeme sa hladkať, škrabkať, +
objímať a bozkávať. +
Budeme si hryzkať do uška +
a šepkať sladké nezmysly. +
Dotýkať sa telami aj slovami.

Škrabkať sa vo vlasoch, +
štekliť sa po nohách, +
túliť sa pod perinou +
v bezpečí, dôvere a radosti. +

Ochutnám tvoje sladké pery, +
stisnem tvoj mäkký zadoček, +
nadýchnem sa tvojich vlasov, +
nežne ťa pohryzkám na krk +
poškrabkám ťa svojimi fúzikmi, +
ktoré si už šiesty týždeň pestujem.

Privinieš si moju hlavu na svoju hruď, +
a budem počúvať tlkot tvojho srdca +
vo vzrušujúcom očakávaní.

Stisneme si naše hrude +
v horúcom objatí, +
a budme tancovať +
ako zemiačiky +
vo vriacej vode +
pôžitku a vášne.

Unavíme sa +
budeme spotení a smrdieť. +
Potom zaspíme. +
Budeme slintať do vankúša, +
prdieť do periny, +
hádzať rukami a nohami, +
chrápať a škrípať zubami, +
keď budeme v hlbokom spánku. +

Bude sa nám snívať +
o jednorožcoch, +
v ružovom vesmíre, ktorí +
skáču po obláčikoch, +
grcajú dúhu, +
a prdia motýle. +

Jesť +
eko, bio, racio, +
raw, vegan, organic +
bezlaktózové a bezlepkové +
potraviny z dovozu. +
Budeme grgať po každom jedle. +
Ach, tá úľava.

Zostarneme mladí, +
a pôjdeme na predčasný dôchodok. +

A budeme mať popiči život :D Ej! Bardzo zajebisty!

Smútiť, plakať,
piť horké slzy
zvíjať sa v bolestiach, zúfalstve
a beznádeji.

Aby sme mohli znova nájsť zmysel,
ktorý sme v chaose stratili.

Unterstützen Hausaufgaben für Punkte die Ausbrennung in den Studenten? +
Ich gehe aus meiner eigenen Erfahrung aus. In der Grundschule, am Gymnasium, an der Uni, ich lernte und arbeitete hart jeden Tag. Von Tag bis Nacht. Ich fühlte mich angespannt und erschöpft. Um die Anspannung zu entspannen, habe ich mich körperlich befriedigt und Computerspiele gespielt. Manchmal bis frühen Morgen über die ganze Nacht. Ich arbeitete, und arbeitete, und spielte, ... Und dann wurde ich krank. Ich unterband mich von meinen Gefühlen und Bedürfnissen. Ich konzentrierte mich auf die Leistung, anstatt auf den Genuss und Freude am Lernen. Das TODO-Liste war mir wichtiger als meine eigene Gesundheit.s

There is no such thing as *_work-life balance_* [under capitalism]. Because the work interferes with my life. Work is life.

Was ich sehe, ist, dass Diktatur, Totalität, Kapitalismus und andere Formen der Erpressung sind sehr intolerant gegen Zärtlichkeit, Empathie, Mitgefühl, Einfühlsamkeit, Verständnis, Pflege, Genuss, Kommunität, Entgegenkommen, Bereitschaft, Sicherheit, Geborgenheit, Mut, Alternative, eigene/intrinsische Motivation, Zusammenarberit (keine Wettbewerbsfähigkeit), Verletzlichkeit. Ich fange an zu glauben, dass wir entweder eine gewaltfreie Zukunft haben, oder keine Zukunft haben. Und wenn eine Revolution entsteht, ich denke, dass die gewaltfreie Möglichkeit die einzige langfristig nachhaltige Möglichkeit ist. Und damit die Revolution gewaltfrei war, wir brauchen lernen, uns um unsere Erpresser zu kümmern.

I see money as a means of oppression. In capitalism, the ones who have money, have security. The ones who don't, can mainly rely on each other, on mutual aid. Sharing. Distribution of power.

Impostor syndrome, capitalism and Peter principle

* One of the things that I didn't want to have happen to me as I entered this new life and lifestyle was I didn't want to begin to think that I had what I had because I'd worked hard, which is one of the patterns of thought very common to upper middle class. I don't believe that I got what I got because I worked hard. I believe that I got what I got *because the [economic] system [of capitalism] favors me* in a number of different ways - one, because I'm white, but also because I started out middle-class. And I think that it's uncomfortable for people who start out with more to be reminded of that. +
So - and I do think that this is damaging in so many ways. The implication is that people who don't have enough have just not worked hard enough, and that's damaging to people who are working extremely hard and still don't have enough because they're being underpaid [or have grown up and educated in different conditions]. But it's also damaging to relationships between people who have more and people who have less if there is this implication hovering in the air that you could have as much as I have if only you just worked a little harder.

Die Ideen, die ich habe, haben keine Benennung. Ich habe keinen einzigen Begriff für sie. Es sind einfach meine Ideen. Unbenannt. Nur beschrieben. Und ich werde sie immer beschreiben, ihren Sinn erklären. Kritisches Denken unterstützen. So etwas kann keiner '-ismus' machen.
Ich sehe Bedürfnisse als eine genauere Beschreibung, obwohl auch immer noch mit etwas Unklarheit und Allgemeinheit, warum jemand etwas macht. Die gute Gründe, warum die Person verhält sich auf einer bestimmten Weise. Dass bedeutet nicht, dass mit mit dem Verhalten der Person einverstanden sein. Das bedeutet, dass ich Empathie der anderen Person zeigen kann, und ihr meinen Sich auf die Situation sagen. Und Empathie ist der Baustein des Friedens. Um die Gewalt so viel wie möglich verringern.
Ich will frei von '-ismen' sein. Kritisch denken. Neugier, Interesse und Freude erregen.

Diese Wunden heilen sich langsam, wenn überhaupt. Sie fangen an klein. Dann verbreiten sie sich. Die Wunden gehen tiefer in die Seele. Bis ins Blut. Und wenn sie auch heilen, es bleibt eine Narbe nach ihnen. Als eine Erinnerung auf die Schmerzen. Auf die Vergangenheit. +

Instead of helping each other, we are competing against each other and earning money from each other. +
Namiesto toho, aby sme si navzájom pomáhali, navzájom súťažíme a zarábame jeden na druhom peniaze.

Gewaltfreie Kommunkation hilft mir mich zu entspannen. Um mit Gewaltfreier Kommunikation zu sprechen brauche ich Mut. Manchmal viel Mut. Wenn ich den Mut sammle, ist es für mich anstrengend, ich muss mir viel Empathie geben. Das trägt zu meiner Müdigkeit und erhöht meinen Adrenalinspiegel. +
Also Gewaltfreie Kommunikation, die Art der Kommunikation die mir hilft, enspannter zu leben, macht mich gleichzeitig mehr müde, angespannt und und letztendlich hilflos und verzweifelt. Der Kreis schließt sich und das Ganze geht vom Anfang an. +
Wiederhole, bis es nich genussbar anfühlt.

zerbrecherliche Zufriedenheit, Selbstleid

---

Was ist mir übriggeblieben? Schmerz, Leiden, Gleichgültigkeit und, vielleicht, Hoffnung.

---

Ich kann mich für immer leiden, oder kann ich etwas dagegen unternehmen. Aber ich bin schon damit versöhnt, dass ich mir noch lange die Sachen persönlich nehmen werde, bis ich lerne, die Giraffenohren zu nutzen.

*Miecha je zbernica.* Nervy sú vodiče, káble. Mozog je procesor, operačná pamäť a trvalé úložisko. Zmysly sú senzory vnímajúce podnety zvonku aj zvnútra (vnímavosť, propriorecepcia). Kosti sú oceľové tyče a dávajú pevnosť. Svaly sú piesty a dávajú pružnosť.

Gleichgewicht zwischen Sympathikus und Parasympathikus. +
Gleichgewicht zwischen der Nummer der Arbeitstage und freie Tage? +
Gleichgewicht zwischen Sympathikus und Parasympathikus innerhalb des Tages. Etwa 12 Stunden aktiv sein und, und der Rest, etwa 12 Stunden erholen und schlafen. +
So stelle ich mir den Work-Life-Balance.

Manchmal sind die Bedürfnisse anderer Menchen für mich sehr schwierig als *wertvolle Geschenke* wahrzunehmen. Es dauert mir, die Worte zu überzusetzen. Aber es ist immer so. Auch wenn die Anderen schreien, kritisieren, provozieren, schlagen, töten, klauen oder irgentetwas gewalttätiges tun und dem Leben schaden, es ist trotzdem ein wertvolles Geschenk, ein Geschenk Gottes, denn alle Menschen hat Gott kreiert. Weil wir alle eine menschliche Familie sind.

Es gibt nicht solches als mentale Krankheit. *Ich sehe mentale Krankheiten als eine Folge von niedriger emotionalen Intelligenz und schwacher Erziehung und Ausbilung zur Empathie und Verantwortung.* Und das kann man nie durch Gehorsamkeit lernen. +
Neexistuje nič také ako psychická choroba. *Psychické choroby vidím ako dôsledok nízkej emocionálnej inteligencie a slabej výchovy a vzdelaniu k empatii a zodpovednosti.* A to sa nikdy nedá naučiť poslušnosťou.

Pokým tu bude výchova, vzdelávanie a inštitúcie založené na notorickej poslušnosti a dominancii, dovtedy tu bude totalita.

I want you to convince me that work doesn't have to be hell. It's like being in prison. What gifts does the experience as if being locked up in a prison bring to me?
