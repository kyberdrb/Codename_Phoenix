"Can you live with it?" - Miki Kashtan [Maximizing Willingness - 1:02:10-1:02:16]

*The Montessori Method*

* Chapter 15: Intellectual Education

** 0:49-1:33

    *** The directress intervenes to lead the child from sensations to ideas, from the concrete to the abstract and to the association of ideas. For this, she uses a method which isolates the inner attention of the child and to focus it upon the perceptions. As in the first lessons, his objective attention was fixed in isolation upon single stimuli. The teacher, in other words, when she gives a lesson limits the field of the child's consciousness to the object of the lesson. As, for example, during the sense education, she isolated the sense which she whished the child to exercise.

** 4:56-6:23

    *** But, if he has not done this, that is, if he makes a mistake, she does not correct him, but suspends her lesson to take it up another day. Indeed, why correct him? If the child has not succeeded in associating the name with the object, the only way in which he succeeds would be to repeat both the action of the sense stimuli and the name. In other words, to repeat the lesson. But when the child has failed, we know, that he was not at that moment ready for the psychic association which we wished to provoke in him. Therefore, we choose another moment. If we correct the child by saying "No, you have made a mistake!", all these words, which, being in the form of reprove, would strike him more forcibly and would remain in the mind of the child retarding the learning. On the contrary, the silence which follows the error leaves the field of consciousness clear and the next lesson may successfully follow the first. In fact, by revealing the error we may lead the child to make an undue effort to remember, or we may discourage him. And it is our responsibility to avoid, as much as possible, all unnatural effort, and all the pressure.

** 8:08-8:17

    *** The teacher carefully watches when and how the child arrives at the generalization of ideas.

** 10:50-11:20

    *** We can not create observers by saying "Observe!", but by giving them the power and the abilities for these observations. And these abilities are obtained through the education of the senses. Once we have aroused such an activity, auto-education is assured. Refined, well-trained senses, lead us to a closer observation of the environment, and this with its infinite variety attracts the attention and continues the psychosensory education.

* Few parents have the courage and independence to care for the children's happines than about their success.
[Erich Fromm; Alfie Kohn - Unconditional Parenting: Moving from Rewards and Punishments to Love and Reason: ch. 5 - "Pushed to succeed", p. 75
; Alfie Kohn at the OFJCC - Performance vs. Learning - The Costs of Overemphasizing Achievement: ???]

* ... because if I persuade you that something ... you're doing with kids is getting in the way, not what I happen to like, but of your own long-term goals for other people then either you have to rethink the practice or you have to rethink the outcome.
(Alfie Kohn at the OFJCC - Performance vs. Learning - The Costs of Overemphasizing Achievement: 10:45-11:04)

* I found that 4 year olds learn this process much faster than adults. And on much deeper level. ... [Nonviolent communication] is faster [to learn] when people have the purpose of it in mind. ... *The purpose is not to get people to get what you want, but to create the quality of connection that everybody's needs get met [compassionately].* That is a radicaly different story that most of us have been taught. *We have been taught, there is a right and a wrong way to do everything. The authorities know what's right. If you want to make it in this world, you have to do what the authorities say is right.* link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqJ-0EIsy9U[(Marshall Rosenberg - NVC Workshop 2004 Portland, OR: 1:59:39-2:00:38)]

* Leadership is not defined by the exercise of power but by the capacity to increase sense of power among those led. The most essential work of the leader is to create more leaders. link:https://scontent.fbts2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/31781853_10156828091695628_8027792006530990080_n.png?_nc_cat=106&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=sdfVZfeBPpoAX84ENlX&_nc_ht=scontent.fbts2-1.fna&oh=35dff8d3e47555a204245ba9ae13be32&oe=5F25FD09[(Mary Parker Follett)]

* There are three ways of dealing with difference: domination, compromise and integration. By domination only one side gets what it wants; by compromise neither side gets what it wants; by integration we find a way by which both sides may get what they wish.

    ** "Can I ...?" - that's how it starts. Alternative questions: "Will I take <something>/Will I <do an action>? What do you say?"
    ** When I say someone, e.g. a child, that he can not do something, then I interfere with what is true physically. I not only control the other, but also mess with their understanding of the reality. If I tell the somebody *No, you can not turn on the TV* when in reality I'm saying *I really don't want you to turn on the TV, and if you turn on the TV I will punish you!*
    ** Between the somebody's action and my reaction is my choice.
    ** We are not sufficiently inner oriented to our own needs and our willingness to decide which consequence to my action am I willing accept. So Nonviolence is to face whatever will be the consequeces of our action so long as they are inline with our needs.
    ** If we are trained to be fearful of our consequeces we're less likely to feel powerful.
    ** Samuel P. Oliner, Pearl M. Oliner - The Altruistic Personality
        *** *People who saved Jews, tended to come from nonpunitive households.*
        *** [big]*If you come from a nonpunitive houshold, you're less oriented towards fear, and more more oriented towards needs and intrinsic motivation.*

    ** ... if you don't have facilitation, you're less likely to have an integrated result.

* *Instead of believing somebody's words to be true, I believe their experience to be true.* ... So I put my focus on their feelings and needs.  ... On their experience behind the words.

* Book - James Gilligan - Violence: Our Deadly Epidemic and its Causes. Every act of violence somewhere is an attempt to create justice to right a wrong that happened before. That wrong may happen two seconds before or might have happened 50 years before. But there's somewhere in the person's deep organism some wrong that have happend that needs to be righted, and the violence is an expression of that. Now we can all understand the pull to justice *but why does it go to violence rather than to other means? Because we feel shame. All the people that he had talked with essentially without exception were carrying boatloads of shame* in them about who they are, about what has happened to them, about what they want, and most particulary, about anything that had to do with tenderness, with any need for love, for connection, for appreciation.* They had so much shame about it. One of the things that are so clear coming out of this is that *punishment makes things worse because it increases shame. If shame is at the root of violence, punishment is not going to work. It only going to make the person get into a deeper loop* about who they are now. "Not only I'm ashamed about everything else, now I'm ashamed about the things that I've done and I've been punished,  I've been ostricized, there's  no room for me." link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msWYVhmuQhw&feature=youtu.be&t=604[(Albany Addresses Bullying: Miki Kashtan: A Compassionate Perspective on Bullying 3/5/2011: 10:04-12:43)]

* Shame is calling me to do self-reflection. And that is sometimes very painful to be willing to do my self-reflection, and to stop projecting my frustrated feelings onto other people. link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pleCht2jN4&feature=youtu.be&t=439[(NVC Guilt and Shame - Kirsten Kristensen: 7:19-7:40)]

* There's a moral transformation, transformation of basic political categories which what a revolution really is. But I think in order to go further with this we need to change our basic categories of what labor is. It's just as in the 19th century, the idea of labor theory of value as material production, was incredibly effective, although it turned out to have very real limits which allowed it to be reversed. We need to change our conceptions of labor to one that starts from caring labor. *What society is, is a process of the mutual creation of human beings. So not just the creation of material world, it's a creation of each other.* That's what we're doing. That's what we're doing right now here. Caring, education are the primary things. There is a free education movement right now in Amsterdam and London, there is a huge student movement emerging. I find this very exciting. One of the first things that they're putting in their plank is that *"We've been told that the purpose of education is to improve economy. We want it backwards. The purpose of the economy is to improve education. To give the people the freedom and leisure to understand the world. To learn things."* Our perspectives are totally backwards. *If you take education as part of that broader process of caring, mutual nurture and mutual support that creates the world by which we create each other.* I think that if we begin to look at the world that way, well of course that's the way the most people who ever lived get see the world. Most societies it's just assumed that material production is just one subordinate moment in a broader process by which we create each other - creating people. *Thus factory labor is a form of carying labor if the stuff you're producing in a factory is that people care about, is that people need. But it's sort of second order form. It's things that are useful in what's the really primary business of human life which is our taking care of each other. And I think that if we transform our categories, begin to rethink the world in that and make that common sense, then we'll truly have achieved a revolution.* link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QUdrdgPI-I&feature=youtu.be&t=1837[(David Graeber: All Economies are Ultimately Human Economies (2015): 30:37-33:)]
